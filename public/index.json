Cataloguers and museum staff create metadata based on standards and rules. This means access is often limited to only those who understand the style used.\nIn order to make objects easier to find by anyone, the Adler invites museum users and guests to help create metadata by creating terms and phrases known as tags. As you add your own tags, you get to see objects that have never been in exhibitions before! The Adler can then take these tags and add them to our online records, adding a vocabulary of our users and hopefully making online searches easier for everyone.\nAs the Adler Planetarium looks to enrich our collections metadata, we ask you to join us and make your voice heard. When you search the web, your ability to find what you are looking for is based on matching the language used on websites. We need your help to ensure we have as many tags/terms as possible to match more people.\nHelp the Adler improve access to our collections by tagging images with the words you would use to search for these images. There is no single right answer. You do not need to know what a certain thing is, or who a certain person is. We want to know how you would describe what you are looking at to a friend, or how you would describe an image to find it again later. That’s your language, and we want to include it!\nAs you “Tag Images”, you will discover new pieces of art from the Adler\u0026rsquo;s rare book, archival photograph, and works on paper collections while adding your language into the Adler’s metadata. “Verify AI Tags” will introduce you to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tagging models. These are computer programs trained to tag images based on terms they learn from museum cataloguers. As you learn more, you will be able to examine the positives and negatives of this emerging technology. Join us and take up the power to tag and to find.\nLocation: Online\n"

At the time of this project launch, fewer than 30 active asteroids have been found since 1949. Finding more active asteroids will enable scientists to study these enigmatic objects as a population. The implications for science and engineering are far-reaching, including:\n Help answer key unsolved questions about how much water was delivered to Earth after it formed, and where that water originated. Advise searches for life about where water \u0026ndash; a prerequisite for life as we understand it \u0026ndash; is found, both in our own solar system and other star systems too. Inform spaceflight engineers seeking more practical, inexpensive, and environmentally responsible sources of fuel, air, and water. Appraise volatile availability for prospective asteroid mining efforts and sample-return missions.  The long timespan and gigantic images taken over 5,000 square degrees of the sky in the Southern Hemisphere means there are many (over 10 million) asteroids to classify! With the generous help of Citizen Scientists we aim to increase the number of known Active Asteroids at least fourfold and encourage study of an ambiguous population of solar system objects, knowledge on which is currently hampered due to a very small sample size.\nLocation: Online\n"

To ensure there are enough resources to go around, managers of public lands in the Southwestern United States conduct waterfowl surveys to know how many birds to expect over winter. Traditional methods of counting birds out in the field present a lot of challenges and may not be very precise. In addition, counting birds manually from photographs takes a lot of time.\nOur lab at the University of New Mexico is working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the Department of Interior to help solve these problems. Currently, we are trying to develop an automated method to count birds from drone imagery using a machine learning algorithm. In order to work, the algorithm needs be \u0026ldquo;trained\u0026rdquo; by being fed a lot of different examples of what a \u0026ldquo;duck\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;goose\u0026rdquo; looks like, and that’s where we need help! In this project, you will label different kinds of birds from images taken from drones at places like Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico. Your labels will help train a computer algorithm to identify and count the birds automatically and ultimately helps federal land managers guide decision making for wildlife conservation!\nLocation: Online\n"

The ER is often one of the biggest structures (organelles) in the cell, and is involved in lots of important cellular processes including the production and transport of new proteins.\nIn this project we need your help to study images of cells that were produced using an Electron Microscope. These microscopes use an electron beam to produce images of molecules, cells and tissues at a very high level of magnification. An important step in studying these images is called “segmentation”; this is where someone draws around structures of interest in the image, like you may have done in our other Etch A Cell projects to study the nuclear envelope or mitochondria.\nWe hope that these projects will advance our ability to analyse biological structures using electron microscopy and segmentation. With enough volunteer help we may be able to train computers to segment automatically. This has huge potential to help us understand biology and study disease!\nLocation: Online\n"

Over the last several years, penguin biologists have been working hard to find all the penguin colonies in Antarctica using satellite imagery. However, the massive expanse of the continent and the challenges of finding each last penguin colony leave many likely undiscovered. This is where you can help!\nPenguins are some of the most charismatic animals in the world and have captured the imaginations of news-makers, scientists, film producers and the general public. Beyond their general intrinsic value, they are considered important ecosystem indicators. That is to say, monitoring these beautiful species can tell us a lot about the general health of the Antarctic. This is because penguins are top predators, and changes (natural or anthropogenic) which influence the oceanography of the region or prey abundance, will ultimately be detected through changes in distribution or population size.\nThe Antarctic is currently governed by nations which make up the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). Management strategies designed by the ATS rely on accurate and citable penguin population data in order to mitigate any anthropogenic impacts in the region. However, data on penguin populations are limited primarily due to the fact that most monitored colonies are nearby permanent research stations. This means that any remote populations are essentially ignored during planning processes. Due to advances in remote sensing, modeling and aerial imagery, it is now possible to obtain population estimates for these hard-to-reach sites.\nMAPPPD aims to deliver population data from four species of penguin to any interested party with the goal of helping support conservation decisions in the Antarctic. We use a combination of highly advanced remote sensing technologies, aerial imagery and field counts to estimate penguin abundance across the entire continent.\nLocation: Online\n"

However, because rainfall in this area is often localized—sometimes almost at the level of one farm—it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to forecast accurately with satellite data, which show larger weather patterns.\nThrough the Africa Rainfall Project, researchers at Delft University of Technology will create high-resolution computer simulations of localized rainstorms in sub-Saharan Africa. Because they\u0026rsquo;ll use massive, crowdsourced computing power from World Community Grid, they\u0026rsquo;ll be able run simulations at a much higher resolution—exactly what\u0026rsquo;s needed for localized rainstorms. This has never been done for rainstorms in this region.\nAs the researchers for the Africa Rainfall Project receive the results of these simulations, they\u0026rsquo;ll be compared with rainfall data from The Weather Company, satellite data, and ground observations. This will help scientists better understand these storms and improve forecasting models. Ultimately, this can lead to more accurate rainfall forecasts for sub-Saharan Africa.

Do you have interest in understanding more about the air quality in your neighborhood? Would you like to measure air quality near your home or place of work? Have you been intrigued by the type of data that NASA collects from their satellites? Then this is the perfect opportunity for you to get involved! Participating in this project will teach you how to interact with and analyze satellite and ground PM data and introduce you to a community of citizen scientists also engaged in this area.\nCurrent NASA Earth Science aerosol products generally report aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is a column measure of aerosol. While AOD is often correlated with surface PM2.5 (fine PM having aerodynamic diameter of ≤ 2.5 µm), it is not a surface measure. Current surface PM2.5 networks are too spatially sparse to evaluate whether AOD gradients can relate to surface PM2.5 gradients. Therefore, our over-arching objective is to add value to NASA\u0026rsquo;s suite of satellite-based observations that relate to surface air quality (AQ). Specifically, we are deploying a network of good-quality, yet \u0026ldquo;low-cost\u0026rdquo; sensors with citizen scientists. By hosting these sensors, citizen scientists can monitor their local PM2.5 loading as well as learn from the project team on how to assess local, regional, and global AQ.\nThis sensor network will generate spatially and temporally resolved AQ data that complement satellite observations. It will both validate and help interpret the current state of satellite-informed PM2.5 estimates. By partnering with citizen scientists, such efforts can be cost-effective and sustainable, while also enhancing NASA’s mission to support the next generation of scientists.\nAnyone not in the regions of focus (Los Angeles, CA, Raleigh, NC, and Delhi, India) may participate in the project, too!

Now a long-standing program of the National Audubon Society, with over 120 years of community science involvement, it is an early-winter bird census, where thousands of volunteers across the U.S., Canada (where Audubon partners with Birds Canada), and many countries in the Western Hemisphere go out over a 24-hour period on one calendar day to count birds.\nEach count takes place in an established 15-mile diameter circle, and is organized by a count compiler. Count volunteers follow specified routes through a designated 15-mile (24-km) diameter circle, counting every bird they see or hear all day. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a species tally—all birds are counted all day, giving an indication of the total number of birds in the circle that day.\nBirders of all skill sets are involved in the CBC. If you are a beginning birder, your compiler will pair you with an expert initially.\nIf your home is within the boundaries of a CBC circle, then you can stay at home and report the birds that visit your feeder on count day as long as you have made prior arrangement with the count compiler.\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz are interested in tracking the number of animals that haul out onto the island\u0026rsquo;s beaches. To study when and where the animals haul out, researchers took drone photos of the island about every two weeks for the past four years.\nAlthough the island is small, thousands of animals can inhabit it at a time, which is where citizen scientists like you come in! We need your help to count each individual animal on a given day. We have divided the drone photos into small sections - some sections may be full of animals, and some may be empty. By helping us classify these photos, you can be part of a collaborative project to better understand how many seals, sea lions, and birds are on Año Nuevo Island during different times of the year, and how the population sizes fluctuate between years. This information can provide important insight into the health of different pinniped and bird populations as well as emphasize the importance of continued protection of Año Nuevo Island and the surrounding areas in Monterey Bay.\nThis project will potentially allow researchers to investigate three important topics:\n The effectiveness of citizen science in simple but large-scale data analysis. A comparison of the success of censuses from the ground versus aerial photographs. Investigation of the changes of seal, sea lion, and bird populations in recent years.

Right now, NASA\u0026rsquo;s cutting-edge satellites, provide a unique capability to capture water quality changes in areas that are economically and environmentally important.\nThere is a long history of public engagement in water quality monitoring in fresh and coastal ecosystems, with volunteer collected data being used as part of monitoring for the US Clean Water Act (Jollymore et al 2017). However, water quality monitoring programs are distributed unequally around the Chesapeake Bay region and some areas lack the capacity to take on large scale monitoring projects or are difficult to access by volunteers. Therefore, this is where remote sensing has enormous potential to fill in these gaps. Having satellites monitor water quality would give researchers an overall picture about things like chlorophyll a, water clarity, and colored dissolved organic matter rather than certain points of these data collected on the ground by researchers and volunteers. These large-scale datasets from satellites would provide a greater understanding of the overall environmental conditions to support aquatic life, and economic and recreational activity.\nHowever, citizen scientists are important in ground truthing and adjusting the algorithms to be more effective and raising awareness about NASA and the projects it provides in understanding Earth’s changing environment.\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

Because humans and chimps are so closely related, patterns in chimpanzee behavior may tell us quite a bit about how the earliest hominids lived and evolved.\nIt is thought that a major leap in the mental, physical, and cultural development of Homo sapiens was associated with increases in hunting, meat-eating, and the use of tools. We sometimes see similar human-like behaviors appear among diverse populations of today’s wild chimpanzees. If we study when, where, and how such behavior is more prominent, we can get a better idea of the evolutionary scenarios that led to the rise of our species.\nchimp-video.gif For this project, we have collected nearly 7,000 hours of footage, reflecting various chimpanzee habitats, from camera traps in 15 countries across Africa.

Marko Jukić, experts with years of experience in computer supported molecular modelling, pharmaceutical chemistry and chemo/bioinformatics.\nWith the help of likeminded volunteers we were able to develop our own technology, which allows distributed computing of molecular docking. The technology is based on a piece of software, which connects the user’s computer to a central server, which distributes a part of our molecular library (currently around 10.000.000 molecules) and collects the docking results, which are computed using RxDock. After analysis of the docked molecules, the results are a list of compounds which have a high potential to bind to a therapeutic target (in our case viral proteins). The next phase is checking the availability of the appropriate compounds and organising in vitro and in vivo testing together with other research groups. The set of unavailable molecules could then be sent to other researchers to be synthesised. In the optimal scenario we would identify molecules interesting for the pharmaceutical industry. In the short term this projects aim is preliminary research, which can help with the development with a cure.\nOur solution for distributive computing is open source, and the software for distributive computing (except for RxDock) was written from the ground up by our team. The source is available on GitHub.\nRuns on:  Linux MacOS Windows  "

To date, only a very small proportion of Davy’s manuscript notebooks have been transcribed and published. What makes Davy’s notebooks especially fascinating is that they are generically mixed, containing records of his thoughts, scientific experiments, poetry, geological observations, travel accounts, and personal philosophy. By joining the Davy Notebooks Project, you can help researchers at Lancaster University and the Royal Institution of Great Britain to transcribe and digitally preserve seventy-five of Davy’s notebooks, used throughout his lifetime. Together, we will learn more about Davy, his work, and the relationship between poetry and science.\nLocation: Online\n"

Now, every May and June during the full and new moon evening high tides, volunteers annually donate their time to count crabs on the beaches of the Delaware Bay in both Delaware and New Jersey. Each lunar date is bracketed with surveys occurring on the day of the peak spawning tide, the prior two days, and the following two days.\nIn October of 1998, The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) Horseshoe Crab Management Plan adopted an annual spawning survey to be conducted along the shores of Delaware Bay. Considering that a Delaware Bay volunteer spawning survey had been in existence since 1990, the ASMFC opted to continue this volunteer-based survey with additional statistical guidance from the United States Geological Service (USGS).\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

They act as a snapshot in time, holding the minerals that came from their parent bodies and are unchanged as they hurtle towards Earth. Studying a meteorite’s composition and tracing its orbit can therefore tell us about what type of body in the Solar System it came from and give us information about the composition of the early solar system that we otherwise wouldn’t be able to discover.\nSending spacecraft on asteroid sample return missions to collect space rocks can cost billions of dollars and take many years. The DFN complements these endeavors using cameras to track where meteorites will land to get ‘free samples’ from a number of different asteroids that come with a way to calculate their orbit. By combining the mineral data with the orbital data we can then create a geological map of the solar system.\nFireballs in the Sky invites everyone to learn about the science behind meteorites and get involved with the project. By downloading the Fireballs in the Sky app, you can report a sighting of a fireball to help our researchers collect data, view sightings by other users, and see information about upcoming meteor showers.

Drug treatment can last up to two years, but when patients interrupt or discontinue treatment, the bacteria can develop resistance. This, along with inconsistent availability of drugs, and increased risk of infection for HIV patients with weakened immune systems, have all contributed to a resurgence of the disease. Nearly half of European cases are now resistant to at least one drug, and 4% of all cases worldwide are resistant to a combination of drugs.\nThe bacterium has an unusual coat which protects it from many drugs and the patient\u0026rsquo;s immune system. Among the fats, sugars and proteins in this coat, the TB bacterium contains a type of fatty molecules called mycolic acids. Help Stop TB will use the massive amount of computing power donated by World Community Grid members to simulate the behavior of these molecules in their many configurations to better understand how they offer protection to the TB bacteria. Scientists hope to use the resulting information to finally develop better treatments for this deadly disease.\nRuns on:  Linux MacOS Windows  "

This was the main clinical site of the Seamen’s Hospital Society (now Seafarer’s Hospital Society), founded with the philanthropic mission of providing relief to sick and injured seafarers of all nations. Throughout the period 1821-1870 it was a floating hospital, based in three successive converted warships, the first named Grampus and later HMS Dreadnought, a veteran of the battle of Trafalgar. It then moved on land and until 1986 occupied the buildings which are now a student hub for the University of Greenwich.\nThe Admissions Registers we are transcribing include details such as a seafarer\u0026rsquo;s name, age and place of birth, rank, employer and last vessel served on. Medical information includes dates of admission and discharge, medical condition, illness or injury and, at discharge, whether they were cured or not! Reflecting the international traffic of the port of London, the patients were seafarers from all over the globe. Casualties from local emergencies, among them women and children, were also admitted, as were naval personnel during wartime.\nTraditionally used by family historians to trace individual maritime ancestors, the records also have significant research potential, including the history of medicine and diseases and the evolution of treatment of specific illnesses and injuries within the maritime workforce. They also show which illnesses were most prevalent in seaman returning from specific parts of the world, together with an almost unlimited number of case studies for examining how treatments changed in response to advances in medical knowledge, and the effect this had on recovery times. In addition, the records also offer additional perspectives on diverse subjects, such as the history of black and Asian communities within the maritime world. Viewed quantitatively, they show the variety and prevalence of disease, injuries and common ailments in the merchant navy for over a hundred years.\nLocation: Online\n"

When Museum visitors mentioned there was a need for a biographical dictionary of colonial personalities to help with research, Macdonald volunteered for the project.\nCompiled by Macdonald between 1952 and 1964, and comprised of over 12000 index cards with biographical information on over 22000 people, the dictionary took about 12 years to complete. Since then it has been accessed by hundreds of people wanting to know more about nineteenth century Canterbury personalities. The dictionary was considered progressive for its inclusion of people from all strata of society. The information included often goes beyond the basic facts and gives a rare insight into the lives of early residents, the businesses they founded, the institutions they were prominent in and the areas in which they lived.\nWhile a monumental achievement, one of the dictionary’s weak spots has been a lack of information on women and children. Most of the entries are organised by male heads of household with women relegated to the role of wife or daughter. In an effort to make women and children more easily findable, a joint public history project between Canterbury Museum and the University of Canterbury is underway.

Monarch butterflies are beautiful, charismatic insects known for their long-distance migration and their reliance on milkweeds (Asclepias species). Milkweeds are the only plants on which monarchs lay their eggs. After the eggs hatch, the caterpillars, also called larvae, eat milkweed leaves to grow. However, over the last 20 years, the number of monarch butterflies in North America has dropped, and one possible cause is a lack of milkweed plants. As efforts to plant more milkweeds are growing, researchers are studying the relationship between milkweeds and monarchs more closely. Some scientists have found preliminary evidence that monarchs prefer to lay eggs on young milkweeds that have not yet started to flower.\nIf monarchs prefer younger, non-flowering plants, scientists can do further experiments to determine why. Perhaps younger plants are easier for the developing caterpillars to eat, or maybe flowering plants attract predators of monarch eggs and caterpillars? Indeed, a number of different insects like ants and beetles, as well as spiders are known to eat eggs and small caterpillars. If data shows that monarchs lay more eggs on non-flowering plants, managing milkweed patches, though mowing or cutting back the plants, may help support monarchs and lessen the declines. Let’s find out, shall we?\nResearch Question: Do monarch butterflies prefer to lay eggs on flowering or non-flowering milkweed stems?\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

From terraforming to fighting viruses! One of the avenues of synthetic biology, and the focus of Nanocrafter, is using synthesized DNA to create biological machines.\nBut actually building the DNA components in real life isn’t very easy, although the price has gone down drastically. Normally, scientists and researchers work with digital models, which will then have to go through a long process before being accepted for synthesis. It’s a process with a strict aim and goal for everyone involved.\nNanocrafter’s goal is to crowdsource creation of interesting digital models and use the same player base to select interesting DNA components. Unlike Foldit, there are no set objectives for players to achieve – it’s simply about finding out what can be done with the DNA fragments we are currently able to synthesize.\nThere’s no shortage of simple puzzle games out there, but Nanocrafter has the exciting advantage of letting you build real world solutions to very real problems, potentially. Among the user projects already submitted, you can find things like self-assembling chains, biological sensors and even logic gates, which are essential pieces for computing.\nAs one of the first citizen science games created without a particular goal in mind, it’ll be exciting to see what the users will eventually come up with. Foldit has had an impressive list of accomplishments, and outperformed computed solutions in many ways. It wouldn’t be surprising to see something completely new come out of Nanocrafter in the next few years.\nLocation: Online\n"

The program takes place in metro-area backyards, as well as at under-resourced schools in cities throughout the U.S.\nAccessing private properties in the course of urban ecology studies can be a major obstacle. Neighborhood Nestwatch overcomes this through its \u0026ldquo;house-call\u0026rdquo; approach, where each backyard or schoolyard involved becomes an outdoor classroom and research site. Participants are not only inspired to learn about local wildlife, but are also mentored to become citizen scientists in their own neighborhoods.\nNestwatch focuses on two basic life-history traits: annual survival and reproductive success. During an annual site visit, where scientists visit participants, birds are temporarily captured and then released. Their measurements are taken, a unique combination of color bands are placed on their legs and their nests are located. The colored bands allow participants to easily recognize a bird that returns to the yard.\nAfter a site visit, participants keep track of the birds they re-sight. The data they collect reflects how long a bird lived in their yard and the surrounding area. Data recorded about a bird\u0026rsquo;s nest sheds light on how well birds are able to reproduce within an area. By submitting their observations, participants help Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center scientists understand how successfully different species are surviving across a range of environments that are impacted by people.e Natural History Museum website.\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

As a young school student, you gained your first experience at breaking an integer into prime factors, such as 15 = 3 * 5 or 35 = 5 * 7. NFS@Home is a continuation of that experience, only with integers that are hundreds of digits long. Most recent large factorizations have been done primarily by large clusters at universities. With NFS@Home you can participate in state-of-the-art factorizations simply by downloading and running a free program on your computer.\nInteger factorization is interesting from both mathematical and practical perspectives. Mathematically, for instance, the calculation of multiplicative functions in number theory for a particular number require the factors of the number. Likewise, the integer factorization of particular numbers can aid in the proof that an associated number is prime. Practically, many public key algorithms, including the RSA algorithm, rely on the fact that the publicly available modulus cannot be factored. If it is factored, the private key can be easily calculated. Until quite recently, RSA-512, which uses a 512-bit modulus (155 digits), was commonly used but can now be easily broken.\nThe numbers that we are factoring are chosen from the Cunningham project. Started in 1925, it is one of the oldest continuously ongoing projects in computational number theory. The third edition of the book, published by the American Mathematical Society in 2002, is available as a free download. All results obtained since, including those of NFS@Home, are available on the Cunningham project website.\nRuns on:  Linux MacOS Windows  "

We will also georeference and transcribe over 320,000 specimens, making their data publicly available on our data portal.\n​​The digitization of herbarium specimens has advanced our ability to understand how organisms respond to changing conditions. However, when a digital record consists only of a taxon name, date, and location, we are limited in the types of research questions we can address. While label data such as these can be used to address changes in species distributions, high-resolution images of herbarium specimens add a rich source of additional information regarding plant health, reproductive condition, and morphology. High-resolution images allow researchers to access and make use of this information. Future digitization efforts will undoubtedly focus on capturing trait data from specimens, greatly expanding the use of specimens in research.\nLocation: Online\n"

Because plants are at the base of the food chain, anything that affects plants can impact other parts of the ecosystem. Phenology is important because it affects plants ability to produce fruits and seeds and food availability for other animals like birds and squirrels. It is important to humans because our food supply depends on plants blooming when pollinators are available. And, to scientists, changes in the timing of phenological events can be used as indicators of changing climates.\nChallenges:\n Fall into Phenology - What autumn changes do you notice in the plants in your neighborhood, schoolyard, or community? Summer Solstice Snapshot - In the heat of summer it can feel as though everything slows down, but the plants around you are still changing. Cherry Blossom Blitz - In many parts of the country, the arrival of cherry blossoms is a sure sign that spring is here.  Location: Outdoors\n"

If you are interested in having your class participate\nGrowing Beyond Earth® (GBE) is a classroom-based citizen science project operated in partnership with NASA. It includes a series of plant experiments conducted by students using equipment similar to the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) on the International Space Station.\nWith experiments currently in progress in more than 250 middle and high schools across the country, GBE is providing a steady stream of valuable data to NASA scientists who are developing technologies for growing food crops for long-duration missions into deep space.\nYOUR CHALLENGE: The search for the perfect food plants to feed astronauts is an ongoing effort. For the past seven years, students from across the country have been helping us provide NASA scientists with data on the best candidates and innovative ideas to improve growing conditions for long-distance space travel. This year we’re exploring radishes. This promising crop produces large amounts of edible biomass (you can eat both the roots and leaves), contains valuable nutrients, and certain varieties mature quickly. Your challenge is to test an assortment of radish cultivars in Trial 1 and apply what you learn to design a second trial that optimizes the radish growing conditions to maximize yield.\nCHAT WITH A SCIENTIST: We will be hosting an OPTIONAL online chat with NASA scientists about the Growing Beyond Earth project. Teachers participating in GBE will receive an invitation a week before each chat with instructions on how to participate.

Rattlesnake rookeries are areas where females come together to give birth and care for their young.

It is really difficult to reach areas where rattlesnakes aggregate like this, both logistically and physically, so our project has the added bonus of making this footage accessible to people from around the world.\nWe placed cameras at Prairie Rattlesnake rookeries and took photos every 5 minutes.

Furthermore, the software used in this area tend to lack effective quality control and computational details are usually incomplete in the articles and the information may not be reused or reproduced. The first objective of this project is to constitute a large collaborative open platform that will solve and store quantum molecular chemistry results. Original output files will be available to be reused to tackle new chemical studies for different applications. Machine learning and more generally artificial intelligence applied to chemistry data promises to revolutionize this area in the near future, but these methods require a lot of data that this project will be able to provide.\nToday, it is impossible for a human to take into account the results, even limited to the most important data, for millions of known molecules. The second objective of this project is to radically change the approach developing artificial intelligence and optimization methods in order to explore efficiently the highly combinatorial molecular space. Generative models aim to provide an artificial assistant, which on the one hand has learned to predict the characteristics of a molecule and estimate its cost of synthesis, and on the other hand is able to browse effectively the molecular space. Generative models would open many perspectives by greatly facilitating the screening of new molecules with many potential applications (energy, medicine, materials, etc.). The bottleneck for our AIs is the computing power needed to verify the properties of the generated molecules.\nBy supporting this project, you will help chemical researchers around the world by building a unique collection of results.

BOINC is secure and will not affect your normal use of the computer.\nBOINC is the preeminent platform for volunteer computing (VC). It is used by most VC projects, including SETI@home, Einstein@home, Climateprediction.net, IBM World Community Grid, and Rosetta@home.\nScience United is a new way to participate in BOINC. With Science United, computer owners volunteer for science areas rather than for specific projects. Science United assigns computers to appropriate projects; these assignments may change over time.\nWe call this the \u0026lsquo;coordinated model\u0026rsquo; for VC. It has the advantage that new projects can get computing power without having to do their own publicity and volunteer recruitment. The goal is to provide the power of VC to thousands of scientists, rather than a few dozen as was previously the case.\nThe user interface of Science United is designed to appeal to a wider audience than the current BOINC user base, which is mostly male and tech-savvy.

The first mission of the project is discovery of possible drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It started as an extension of the project COVID.SI to engage the BOINC community into the drug discovery.\nYou can help with your computer. With the help of BOINC, you will download a subset of compounds on your computer, examine the compounds in the context of the studied target and send the results to a server where they are collected for later analysis.\nIn our project, we are looking for ligands – small molecules that can successfully bind to protein targets and modulate a specific process that is crucial for the virus biochemistry. Based on molecular docking, the ideal ligand should be complementary in shape and properties to the binding site of the target biomolecule. However, the complementarity of small molecules is only one prerequisite for the use of a molecule as a drug.\nThe search for the right molecule is best illustrated by finding a small needle in a huge haystack. It is a much more difficult problem because of the number of possible molecular structures. The amount of all possible molecular structures is also called the chemical universe – the size of this abstract space can be estimated to be 10 to the power of 80. There are many galaxies in this chemical universe, and one of the galaxies is a galaxy with potentially pharmacologically active molecules. The method for this purpose is called virtual screening. In principle, the larger the part of the chemical universe that we study, the higher the likelihood of finding a potential cure for the coronavirus.\nRuns on:  Linux MacOS Windows  "

	"content": "Stardust@home View the project here.\nOverview On January 15, 2006, the Stardust spacecraft’s sample return capsule parachuted gently onto the Utah desert. Nestled within the capsule were precious particles collected during Stardust’s dramatic encounter with comet Wild 2 in January of 2004; and something else, even rarer and no less precious: tiny particles of interstellar dust that originated in distant stars, light-years away. They are the first such contemporary interstellar dust particles ever collected in space and returned to Earth for study.\nBefore they can be studied, though, these tiny interstellar grains have to be found. As we have discovered since we started the Stardust@home project in 2006, this is not easy. Unlike the thousands of particles of varying sizes collected from the comet, scientists originally estimated that Stardust would collect only around 45 interstellar dust particles. After a thorough search of about one-third of the collector, we have so far found only four particles that appear to be interstellar. So they are incredibly rare and precious. They are tiny only about a micron (a millionth of a meter) in size! These miniscule particles are embedded in an aerogel collector 1,000 square centimeters in size. To make things worse the collector plates are interspersed with flaws, cracks, and an uneven surface. All this makes the interstellar dust particles extremely difficult to locate.\nIf we were doing this project twenty years ago, we would have searched for the tracks through a typical laboratory microscope of the era. Because the view of the microscope is so small, we would have had to move the microscope more than 1.6 million times to search the whole collector. And in each field of view, we would have had to focus up and down by hand to look for the tracks. This is so much work, that even starting twenty years ago, we would still be doing it today!\nSince we cannot do this by ourselves, we are asking for help from talented volunteers like you from all over the world. Of course, we can’t invite hundreds of people to our lab to do this search-we only have two microscopes! To find the elusive particles , therefore, we are using an automated scanning microscope to automatically collect images of the entire Stardust interstellar collector at the Curatorial Facility at Johnson Space Center in Houston. We call these stacks of images focus movies. All in all there will be nearly a million such focus movies. These are available to Stardust@home users like you around the world. You can then view them with the aid of a specialVirtual Microscope (VM) that works in your web browser.\nTogether, you and thousands of other Stardust@home participants will find the first pristine interstellar dust particles ever brought to Earth.\nLocation: Online\n"

	"content": "Stardust@home View the project here.\nOverview The interstellar dust particles returned to Earth by the Stardust mission are the first such pristine dust particles ever collected in space, and scientists are eager to “get their hands” on them. We estimate that Stardust collected less than 100 interstellar dust particles. They are tiny-only about a micron (a millionth of a meter) in size! These miniscule particles were captured in an aerogel collector about 1,000 square centimeters in size, and in about 150 square centimeters of aluminum metal foils. Finding them is something like searching for a handful of ants on a football field while searching one 5 cm x 5 cm square at a time.\nBy asking for help from talented volunteers like you from all over the world, we can do this project in a lot less time than it would take a handful of scientists and lab technicians to do alone. To find the tiny particles we are using two methods. Together, you and thousands of other Stardust@home participants will find the first pristine interstellar dust particles ever brought to Earth.\nThe search will take several years to complete. Our automated microscope at the Johnson Space Center can scan about one tile of aerogel from the Stardust interstellar dust collector tray per day. There are 130 tiles in total. We may have false starts (in fact, we already have), where we discover a problem and have to rescan one or more tiles. For example, once we find a dust track, we may decide to change the lighting conditions or the scanning parameters so that the scans are better. Please be patient with us!\nIn recognition of the critical importance of the Stardust@home volunteers, the discoverer of an interstellar dust particle appears as a co-author on any scientific paper by the Stardust@home team announcing the discovery of the particle. The discoverer also has the privilege of naming the particle! Each particle, as it is discovered, will be given some kind of alpha-numeric identifier (an address of sorts) for book-keeping purposes. But the name that people will actually call each particle will be given to it by its discoverer. For example, Bruce Hudson of Ontario, Canada, discovered our first candidate interstellar dust track. Its official NASA “phone number” is “I1043,1,30,0,0” – which is very hard to remember and doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue. So we asked Bruce to give it a name to publish it by, and he decided on “Orion”, and then later “Sirius” for the accompanying upstream particle that was discovered very nearby. Bruce was featured in a recent article in Nature on Citizen Science projects. To also recognize the efforts of our volunteers who work hard, but may not have found a particle, we will invite the top-ranked volunteers to come visit our lab in Berkeley for a special tour.

And at various stages in data processing, researchers have to check images to make sure the analysis is correct. This can get really unweildy when we have large datasets, which are needed to really understand the brain. Citizen science games like EyeWire have been really successful for brain analysis, but it is built for one specific type of data, and its really hard to adapt for a different use-case.

This site will allow you to submit dragonfly migration observations.\nCurrent projects:\n  Dragonfly Pond Watch Participants visit the same pond or wetland regularly throughout the year and note the presence, emergence, and behaviors of any of the five main migratory dragon-fly species.\n  Migration Monitoring Participants monitor the timing, duration, and direction of travel of migrating dragonflies, and note any additional behaviors observed in a migratory flight such as feeding or mating. Photos or videos are strongly encouraged to aid in identification. When gathered across a wide geographic range and throughout a span of years, these data will provide answers to questions about which species are regular migrants; the frequency and timing of migration in different species; sources, routes, and destinations of migrants; and patterns of reproduction, emergence, and movement among migratory dragonflies along their flight paths.\n  Location: Outdoors\n"

You can apply to join this project if you are a hiker, a birder, a biker, a forager, or a tree lover to explore the hardwood forests of the eastern and central United States in search of black walnut trees!.\nOne of the most valuable hardwood species in the United States, black walnut trees are threatened by timber poaching across the 30+ states in their range. Timber prices are skyrocketing and a black walnut tree can be worth $50,000, making them especially attractive to thieves. This impressive species is a critical part of the canopy as well as a valuable food source for fox squirrels and other creatures. It\u0026rsquo;s well worth protecting.\nThe species has been cloned and planted across the world, so your backcountry skills are especially needed to take samples from wild trees on public lands. Those samples will become the basis of chemical and DNA databases that law enforcement can use to prosecute timber thieves.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re collecting thousands of leaf, seed, and wood samples to create databases of the chemical and genetic signatures of tree species throughout their ranges. This information will power new tools to reveal the origin of any sample of timber––taking away illegal loggers' ability to sneak poached trees into the world\u0026rsquo;s wood supply.\nSample collection for eastern black walnut will kick off in July 2021. Data collection will take place on public lands (forests, refuges, reserves) throughout the Eastern black walnut range in the US. These trees grow from western Connecticut and Massachusetts to the coast of North Carolina, from Georgia and west until eastern Texas, north through Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska, and across the southern regions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York.\nOnce collected, our samples will undergo two forms of processing: Mass Spectrometry-Data Analysis in Real Time (MS-DART or DART) and genetic analysis.\nWe are seeking adventurous individuals who will follow detailed protocols, communicate regularly with the Adventure Scientists team, and follow through on their commitments in a timely matter.\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

Our knowledge grows faster than ever before. We explore the structures of the Universe, nuclei of stars and evolution of galaxies. Using the strength of our minds we crack problems that are not tangible and cannot be examined in laboratory. The technology came as an aid in this struggle. The computers help us to calculate complicated problems and to model extraordinary objects. Therefore the need for computational power is growing exponentially in the scientists' community.\nIn a different situation are millions of people around the world. The computers industry is evolving extremely quickly and personal computers are available for constantly decreasing prises. Simultaneously, these machines must be strong enough to fulfil the growing needs of users who want to play the newest games and use resources-demanding programs. However, most of the time such computers spend in the idle state when they are used for simple web-browsing or document-writing. The most of computational power stays unused.\nAs a remedy to both these issues have came the BOINC platform. The innovative infrastructure, which, from one side, serves as the source of huge computational power, and from the other side, gives people the possibility to become involved in huge contemporary science projects utilising their limited resources. BOINC stands for Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing. This system was used for the first time in year 1999 and afterwards dozens of other projects have came into existence. In 2014 the time came for adopting this idea in polish astronomy projects and, at first, the fundamental problems of the stellar evolution will be solved.\nRuns on:  Linux MacOS Windows  "

This information will be used to train deep learning models that will be able to identify humpback whale sounds in recordings, to classify calls, and to search for underlying structure, hopefully allowing better understanding of the song’s function. If it is possible to identify individually distinct calls, then this information could be used to track migrating whales acoustically, helping to get valuable information about humpback whale populations and their health.\nBased on both currently running projects, Dolphin Chat and Manatee Chat, we will be offering additional training and practice for citizen scientists.
