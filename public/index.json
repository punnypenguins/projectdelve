	"content": "The Project Project Delve was originally conceived as a one-stop-shop where people could find only active distributed computing and citizen science projects, and find all of them—no more needing to search google, click through pages of listings on various project hub sites, or clicking through fifty links just to find that all but seven of them were months or years out of date.\nThe point is, I got frustrated, decided to do something about it, taught myself to build a site, and threw this whole thing together in about a month.\nAs I started to build the site in earnest, I came across so many other online volunteer projects for historical records, media archives, and fields in the humanities, that I decided to expand the scope of Project Delve to include those too.\nIn its current iteration, Project Delve holds six major categories of volunteer projects:\n Distributed computing projects Historical record and archive projects Hub websites that host or point you toward many more projects Projects from various fields in the humanities Citizen science projects that can be done on devices alone Citizen science projects that require you to go outside at least once  I will be adding more projects to the site as I find them and as people send them to me. As of right now, the website contains individual listings of every active project I found around the internet except for those from many of the websites in the \u0026ldquo;Hub Websites\u0026rdquo; section. I intended to add those as well, but as some of them had hundreds to 1,000+ projects listed, I decided it would be a better user experience if you didn\u0026rsquo;t have to scroll through hundreds and hundreds of projects on this one static web page.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for more projects than you find listed individually on here, make sure you check the hub websites out; you\u0026rsquo;ll find many of them probably have exactly the category you were looking for.\nThe Creator I\u0026rsquo;m Katie.

At the time of this project launch, fewer than 30 active asteroids have been found since 1949. Finding more active asteroids will enable scientists to study these enigmatic objects as a population. The implications for science and engineering are far-reaching, including:\n Help answer key unsolved questions about how much water was delivered to Earth after it formed, and where that water originated. Advise searches for life about where water \u0026ndash; a prerequisite for life as we understand it \u0026ndash; is found, both in our own solar system and other star systems too. Inform spaceflight engineers seeking more practical, inexpensive, and environmentally responsible sources of fuel, air, and water. Appraise volatile availability for prospective asteroid mining efforts and sample-return missions.  The long timespan and gigantic images taken over 5,000 square degrees of the sky in the Southern Hemisphere means there are many (over 10 million) asteroids to classify! With the generous help of Citizen Scientists we aim to increase the number of known Active Asteroids at least fourfold and encourage study of an ambiguous population of solar system objects, knowledge on which is currently hampered due to a very small sample size.\nLocation: Online\n"

	"content": "Africa Rainfall Project View the project here.\nOverview In sub-Saharan Africa, 95 percent of agriculture depends on rainfall, which makes accurate weather forecasts absolutely crucial. However, because rainfall in this area is often localized—sometimes almost at the level of one farm—it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to forecast accurately with satellite data, which show larger weather patterns.\nThrough the Africa Rainfall Project, researchers at Delft University of Technology will create high-resolution computer simulations of localized rainstorms in sub-Saharan Africa. Because they\u0026rsquo;ll use massive, crowdsourced computing power from World Community Grid, they\u0026rsquo;ll be able run simulations at a much higher resolution—exactly what\u0026rsquo;s needed for localized rainstorms. This has never been done for rainstorms in this region.\nAs the researchers for the Africa Rainfall Project receive the results of these simulations, they\u0026rsquo;ll be compared with rainfall data from The Weather Company, satellite data, and ground observations. This will help scientists better understand these storms and improve forecasting models. Ultimately, this can lead to more accurate rainfall forecasts for sub-Saharan Africa. In turn, this could give farmers more timely information about when to plant, help them obtain insurance, and become more resilient in the face of climate change.\nRuns on:  Linux MacOS Windows  "

Do you have interest in understanding more about the air quality in your neighborhood? Would you like to measure air quality near your home or place of work? Have you been intrigued by the type of data that NASA collects from their satellites? Then this is the perfect opportunity for you to get involved! Participating in this project will teach you how to interact with and analyze satellite and ground PM data and introduce you to a community of citizen scientists also engaged in this area.\nCurrent NASA Earth Science aerosol products generally report aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is a column measure of aerosol. While AOD is often correlated with surface PM2.5 (fine PM having aerodynamic diameter of ≤ 2.5 µm), it is not a surface measure. Current surface PM2.5 networks are too spatially sparse to evaluate whether AOD gradients can relate to surface PM2.5 gradients. Therefore, our over-arching objective is to add value to NASA\u0026rsquo;s suite of satellite-based observations that relate to surface air quality (AQ). Specifically, we are deploying a network of good-quality, yet \u0026ldquo;low-cost\u0026rdquo; sensors with citizen scientists. By hosting these sensors, citizen scientists can monitor their local PM2.5 loading as well as learn from the project team on how to assess local, regional, and global AQ.\nThis sensor network will generate spatially and temporally resolved AQ data that complement satellite observations. It will both validate and help interpret the current state of satellite-informed PM2.5 estimates. By partnering with citizen scientists, such efforts can be cost-effective and sustainable, while also enhancing NASA’s mission to support the next generation of scientists.\nAnyone not in the regions of focus (Los Angeles, CA, Raleigh, NC, and Delhi, India) may participate in the project, too! Please fill out the Raleigh/Delhi questionnaire and the project team will contact you with upcoming workshops shared over video conference.\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

Some counts have been running every year since then and the CBC now happens in over 20 countries in the western hemisphere! Read about the history here. Now a long-standing program of the National Audubon Society, with over 120 years of community science involvement, it is an early-winter bird census, where thousands of volunteers across the U.S., Canada (where Audubon partners with Birds Canada), and many countries in the Western Hemisphere go out over a 24-hour period on one calendar day to count birds.\nEach count takes place in an established 15-mile diameter circle, and is organized by a count compiler. Count volunteers follow specified routes through a designated 15-mile (24-km) diameter circle, counting every bird they see or hear all day. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a species tally—all birds are counted all day, giving an indication of the total number of birds in the circle that day.\nBirders of all skill sets are involved in the CBC. If you are a beginning birder, your compiler will pair you with an expert initially.\nIf your home is within the boundaries of a CBC circle, then you can stay at home and report the birds that visit your feeder on count day as long as you have made prior arrangement with the count compiler.\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

Right now, NASA\u0026rsquo;s cutting-edge satellites, provide a unique capability to capture water quality changes in areas that are economically and environmentally important.\nThere is a long history of public engagement in water quality monitoring in fresh and coastal ecosystems, with volunteer collected data being used as part of monitoring for the US Clean Water Act (Jollymore et al 2017). However, water quality monitoring programs are distributed unequally around the Chesapeake Bay region and some areas lack the capacity to take on large scale monitoring projects or are difficult to access by volunteers. Therefore, this is where remote sensing has enormous potential to fill in these gaps. Having satellites monitor water quality would give researchers an overall picture about things like chlorophyll a, water clarity, and colored dissolved organic matter rather than certain points of these data collected on the ground by researchers and volunteers. These large-scale datasets from satellites would provide a greater understanding of the overall environmental conditions to support aquatic life, and economic and recreational activity.\nHowever, citizen scientists are important in ground truthing and adjusting the algorithms to be more effective and raising awareness about NASA and the projects it provides in understanding Earth’s changing environment.\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

	"content": "Chimp and See View the project here.\nOverview Studies of human evolution often focus on the fossils and artifacts left by our early ancestors. However, we can also make inferences about human origins by studying our closest living relatives: chimpanzees, the great apes that live across equatorial Africa. Because humans and chimps are so closely related, patterns in chimpanzee behavior may tell us quite a bit about how the earliest hominids lived and evolved.\nIt is thought that a major leap in the mental, physical, and cultural development of Homo sapiens was associated with increases in hunting, meat-eating, and the use of tools. We sometimes see similar human-like behaviors appear among diverse populations of today’s wild chimpanzees. If we study when, where, and how such behavior is more prominent, we can get a better idea of the evolutionary scenarios that led to the rise of our species.\nchimp-video.gif For this project, we have collected nearly 7,000 hours of footage, reflecting various chimpanzee habitats, from camera traps in 15 countries across Africa. (We are also collecting a wide variety of organic samples from these sites, such as feces, hair, and plant matter, and information on the ecology and environment of each habitat.) By scanning the videos from these traps and identifying the types of species and activity that you see, you’ll help us to understand the lives of these apes—their behaviors, relationships, and environments—and to extrapolate new ideas about human origins.\nLocation: Online\n"

There is a disconnect between how doctors think about the disease and what patients experience on a daily basis. Bridging this gap is critical to further research on endometriosis. Citizen Endo will use a series of studies to better understand the disease from the perspective of patients.\nWe are academic researchers who make tools (like mobile apps) to collect health data, explore it, and generate meaningful insights. We need patients' help to make this project a success. Success means engaging patients as active participants in our research so that we can gain a comprehensive description of the disease through patient-generated health data.

Dozens of fungi can occupy a single handful of soil and many of them are adept at making new compounds called natural products. These remarkable molecules hold tremendous promise for treating human diseases.\nIt only takes a few minutes to help by collecting a scoop of soil.\nEstablished in 2010 as the first operation of its kind, the Citizen Science Soil Collection Program is asking you for your dirt. You can play a vital role in this important research.\nOver the last century, researchers have obtained many important drugs from fungi including antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering medicines, and immunosuppressants. Astonishingly, all of these drugs were found based on efforts that explored roughly just 5% of the Earth’s fungal species. With so much potential to provide new medicines, our research group is working to test as many new fungi as possible for drug-like molecules. But we cannot do this job on our own – we need your help. Whether you live in a big city, a rural town, or the pristine wilderness, the soil in your yard is teeming with new and untested fungi. To start your journey toward becoming a citizen scientist, all we ask is for you to send us a small scoop of soil from your yard. This simple, yet important act will help our team to continue the process of exploring fungi as a source of new medicines.\nWe want you to continue the journey with us as we test samples and add them to our open-access data sharing website. Using the online ShareOK system, you can view photos of fungi from your sample, find out about the types of fungi that were discovered, and compare your results to those from people living in your region and across the nation. We also offer a variety of online educational materials that enable citizen scientists both young and old to continue the quest by digging deeper into the world of fungi and drug discovery.\nRequest a kit here.\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

The technology is based on a piece of software, which connects the user’s computer to a central server, which distributes a part of our molecular library (currently around 10.000.000 molecules) and collects the docking results, which are computed using RxDock. After analysis of the docked molecules, the results are a list of compounds which have a high potential to bind to a therapeutic target (in our case viral proteins). The next phase is checking the availability of the appropriate compounds and organising in vitro and in vivo testing together with other research groups. The set of unavailable molecules could then be sent to other researchers to be synthesised. In the optimal scenario we would identify molecules interesting for the pharmaceutical industry. In the short term this projects aim is preliminary research, which can help with the development with a cure.\nOur solution for distributive computing is open source, and the software for distributive computing (except for RxDock) was written from the ground up by our team.

To date, only a very small proportion of Davy’s manuscript notebooks have been transcribed and published. What makes Davy’s notebooks especially fascinating is that they are generically mixed, containing records of his thoughts, scientific experiments, poetry, geological observations, travel accounts, and personal philosophy.

They act as a snapshot in time, holding the minerals that came from their parent bodies and are unchanged as they hurtle towards Earth. Studying a meteorite’s composition and tracing its orbit can therefore tell us about what type of body in the Solar System it came from and give us information about the composition of the early solar system that we otherwise wouldn’t be able to discover.\nSending spacecraft on asteroid sample return missions to collect space rocks can cost billions of dollars and take many years. The DFN complements these endeavors using cameras to track where meteorites will land to get ‘free samples’ from a number of different asteroids that come with a way to calculate their orbit. By combining the mineral data with the orbital data we can then create a geological map of the solar system.\nFireballs in the Sky invites everyone to learn about the science behind meteorites and get involved with the project. By downloading the Fireballs in the Sky app, you can report a sighting of a fireball to help our researchers collect data, view sightings by other users, and see information about upcoming meteor showers.

The number of different ways even a small protein can fold is astronomical because there are so many degrees of freedom. Figuring out which of the many, many possible structures is the best one is regarded as one of the hardest problems in biology today and current methods take a lot of money and time, even for computers. Foldit attempts to predict the structure of a protein by taking advantage of humans' puzzle-solving intuitions and having people play competitively to fold the best proteins.\nSince proteins are part of so many diseases, they can also be part of the cure.

About one-third of the world\u0026rsquo;s population harbors the TB bacterium, with 1.5 million people dying in 2014 alone, and the World Health Organization now ranks TB alongside HIV as the world\u0026rsquo;s deadliest infectious disease. Through Help Stop TB, researchers are using World Community Grid to help fight this deadly disease.\nAlthough a vaccine and several drugs have been developed to help combat TB, the TB bacterium has been evolving resistance to available treatments. Drug treatment can last up to two years, but when patients interrupt or discontinue treatment, the bacteria can develop resistance. This, along with inconsistent availability of drugs, and increased risk of infection for HIV patients with weakened immune systems, have all contributed to a resurgence of the disease. Nearly half of European cases are now resistant to at least one drug, and 4% of all cases worldwide are resistant to a combination of drugs.\nThe bacterium has an unusual coat which protects it from many drugs and the patient\u0026rsquo;s immune system. Among the fats, sugars and proteins in this coat, the TB bacterium contains a type of fatty molecules called mycolic acids. Help Stop TB will use the massive amount of computing power donated by World Community Grid members to simulate the behavior of these molecules in their many configurations to better understand how they offer protection to the TB bacteria. Scientists hope to use the resulting information to finally develop better treatments for this deadly disease.\nRuns on:  Linux MacOS Windows  "

This was the main clinical site of the Seamen’s Hospital Society (now Seafarer’s Hospital Society), founded with the philanthropic mission of providing relief to sick and injured seafarers of all nations. Throughout the period 1821-1870 it was a floating hospital, based in three successive converted warships, the first named Grampus and later HMS Dreadnought, a veteran of the battle of Trafalgar. It then moved on land and until 1986 occupied the buildings which are now a student hub for the University of Greenwich.\nThe Admissions Registers we are transcribing include details such as a seafarer\u0026rsquo;s name, age and place of birth, rank, employer and last vessel served on. Medical information includes dates of admission and discharge, medical condition, illness or injury and, at discharge, whether they were cured or not! Reflecting the international traffic of the port of London, the patients were seafarers from all over the globe. Casualties from local emergencies, among them women and children, were also admitted, as were naval personnel during wartime.\nTraditionally used by family historians to trace individual maritime ancestors, the records also have significant research potential, including the history of medicine and diseases and the evolution of treatment of specific illnesses and injuries within the maritime workforce. They also show which illnesses were most prevalent in seaman returning from specific parts of the world, together with an almost unlimited number of case studies for examining how treatments changed in response to advances in medical knowledge, and the effect this had on recovery times. In addition, the records also offer additional perspectives on diverse subjects, such as the history of black and Asian communities within the maritime world. Viewed quantitatively, they show the variety and prevalence of disease, injuries and common ailments in the merchant navy for over a hundred years.\nLocation: Online\n"

Since then it has been accessed by hundreds of people wanting to know more about nineteenth century Canterbury personalities. The dictionary was considered progressive for its inclusion of people from all strata of society. The information included often goes beyond the basic facts and gives a rare insight into the lives of early residents, the businesses they founded, the institutions they were prominent in and the areas in which they lived.\nWhile a monumental achievement, one of the dictionary’s weak spots has been a lack of information on women and children. Most of the entries are organised by male heads of household with women relegated to the role of wife or daughter. In an effort to make women and children more easily findable, a joint public history project between Canterbury Museum and the University of Canterbury is underway.

Over the last several years, penguin biologists have been working hard to find all the penguin colonies in Antarctica using satellite imagery. However, the massive expanse of the continent and the challenges of finding each last penguin colony leave many likely undiscovered. This is where you can help!\nPenguins are some of the most charismatic animals in the world and have captured the imaginations of news-makers, scientists, film producers and the general public. Beyond their general intrinsic value, they are considered important ecosystem indicators. That is to say, monitoring these beautiful species can tell us a lot about the general health of the Antarctic. This is because penguins are top predators, and changes (natural or anthropogenic) which influence the oceanography of the region or prey abundance, will ultimately be detected through changes in distribution or population size.\nThe Antarctic is currently governed by nations which make up the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). Management strategies designed by the ATS rely on accurate and citable penguin population data in order to mitigate any anthropogenic impacts in the region. However, data on penguin populations are limited primarily due to the fact that most monitored colonies are nearby permanent research stations. This means that any remote populations are essentially ignored during planning processes. Due to advances in remote sensing, modeling and aerial imagery, it is now possible to obtain population estimates for these hard-to-reach sites.\nMAPPPD aims to deliver population data from four species of penguin to any interested party with the goal of helping support conservation decisions in the Antarctic. We use a combination of highly advanced remote sensing technologies, aerial imagery and field counts to estimate penguin abundance across the entire continent.\nLocation: Online\n"

Monarch butterflies are beautiful, charismatic insects known for their long-distance migration and their reliance on milkweeds (Asclepias species). Milkweeds are the only plants on which monarchs lay their eggs. After the eggs hatch, the caterpillars, also called larvae, eat milkweed leaves to grow. However, over the last 20 years, the number of monarch butterflies in North America has dropped, and one possible cause is a lack of milkweed plants. As efforts to plant more milkweeds are growing, researchers are studying the relationship between milkweeds and monarchs more closely. Some scientists have found preliminary evidence that monarchs prefer to lay eggs on young milkweeds that have not yet started to flower.\nIf monarchs prefer younger, non-flowering plants, scientists can do further experiments to determine why. Perhaps younger plants are easier for the developing caterpillars to eat, or maybe flowering plants attract predators of monarch eggs and caterpillars? Indeed, a number of different insects like ants and beetles, as well as spiders are known to eat eggs and small caterpillars. If data shows that monarchs lay more eggs on non-flowering plants, managing milkweed patches, though mowing or cutting back the plants, may help support monarchs and lessen the declines.

During an annual site visit, where scientists visit participants, birds are temporarily captured and then released. Their measurements are taken, a unique combination of color bands are placed on their legs and their nests are located. The colored bands allow participants to easily recognize a bird that returns to the yard.\nAfter a site visit, participants keep track of the birds they re-sight.

As a young school student, you gained your first experience at breaking an integer into prime factors, such as 15 = 3 * 5 or 35 = 5 * 7. NFS@Home is a continuation of that experience, only with integers that are hundreds of digits long. Most recent large factorizations have been done primarily by large clusters at universities. With NFS@Home you can participate in state-of-the-art factorizations simply by downloading and running a free program on your computer.\nInteger factorization is interesting from both mathematical and practical perspectives. Mathematically, for instance, the calculation of multiplicative functions in number theory for a particular number require the factors of the number. Likewise, the integer factorization of particular numbers can aid in the proof that an associated number is prime. Practically, many public key algorithms, including the RSA algorithm, rely on the fact that the publicly available modulus cannot be factored. If it is factored, the private key can be easily calculated. Until quite recently, RSA-512, which uses a 512-bit modulus (155 digits), was commonly used but can now be easily broken.\nThe numbers that we are factoring are chosen from the Cunningham project. Started in 1925, it is one of the oldest continuously ongoing projects in computational number theory. The third edition of the book, published by the American Mathematical Society in 2002, is available as a free download. All results obtained since, including those of NFS@Home, are available on the Cunningham project website.\nRuns on:  Linux MacOS Windows  "

This project will generate data that will be used to help improve our AI model performance. We are trying to find the germinal centres, the light pink circles in lymph nodes. When the immune system spot something foreign, new immune cells were produced in germinal centres of lymph nodes. We are a computational group and work on artificial intelligence (AI) methods to capture these germinal centres in lymph nodes. In this project, we will compare our AI methods with your data.\nIn this project we need your help to study images of lymph nodes that were produced using whole slide image scanners (WSI scanner). A WSI scanner consists of an electron microscope and a computer. It scans the slides in a high magnification (max. 40x) which allows us to see every cell in this lymph node. An important step in studying these images is called “segmentation”: it describes the process in which someone or a computer program draws around the region of interest. We need your help to do this segmentation step!\nWith enough help from volunteers, we will improve further our AI model to perform the segmentation better. This has a huge potential to study breast cancer!\nLocation: Online\n"

However, access to data is impractical for most of the research community.\nBecause of enormous collection sizes, entomology has lagged behind other disciplines in digitizing collections.

In July 2020, this network was expanded by a partner-to-existing-network grant to include six additional institutions and over 148,000 more specimens, for a total of over one million specimens. We will also georeference and transcribe over 320,000 specimens, making their data publicly available on our data portal.\n​​The digitization of herbarium specimens has advanced our ability to understand how organisms respond to changing conditions. However, when a digital record consists only of a taxon name, date, and location, we are limited in the types of research questions we can address. While label data such as these can be used to address changes in species distributions, high-resolution images of herbarium specimens add a rich source of additional information regarding plant health, reproductive condition, and morphology. High-resolution images allow researchers to access and make use of this information. Future digitization efforts will undoubtedly focus on capturing trait data from specimens, greatly expanding the use of specimens in research.\nLocation: Online\n"

Arthropod-borne pathogens can also have a significant impact on our livestock, which poses a serious threat to agriculture and food security globally. Entomology collections around the world host valuable information about the diversity and distribution of these arthropod vectors through space and time, yet these data have not been synthesized or made visible to scientists across the many relevant disciplines.\nThe goal of the Terrestrial Parasite Tracker (TPT) project is to mobilize and digitally capture vector and parasite collections to help build a picture of parasite host-association evolution, distributions, and the ecological interactions of disease vectors which will assist scientists, educators, land managers, and policy makers\nLocation: Online\n"

Weather observations were logged on every ship, every hour, almost without fail. This was done even in the midst of battle, in the heart of a typhoon, or in the fatal grip of the Arctic icepack. Now, with the challenge of climate change upon us, it is astonishing that most of this legacy is still unused and unknown.

FeederWatch is a November-April survey of birds that visit backyards, nature centers, community areas, and other locales in North America. You don’t even need a feeder! All you need is an area with plantings, habitat, water or food that attracts birds. The schedule is completely flexible. Count your birds for as long as you like on days of your choosing, then enter your counts online. Your counts allow you to track what is happening to birds around your home and contribute to a continental data-set of bird distribution and abundance.\nWe will send you everything else you need to get started identifying birds. New participants receive a Welcome Kit that includes a bird identification poster and a calendar. Each fall participants receive Winter Bird Highlights, our annual summary of results from the prior season. Participants also receive access to the digital version of Living Bird, the Cornell Lab’s award-winning, quarterly magazine.\nProject FeederWatch is supported almost entirely by its participants. The annual participation fee is $18 for U.S. residents ($15 for Cornell Lab members). Canadians can participate by donating any amount to Birds Canada. These contributions cover materials, staff support, web design, data analysis, and the year-end report (Winter Bird Highlights).

If you are interested in having your class participate\nGrowing Beyond Earth® (GBE) is a classroom-based citizen science project operated in partnership with NASA. It includes a series of plant experiments conducted by students using equipment similar to the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) on the International Space Station.\nWith experiments currently in progress in more than 250 middle and high schools across the country, GBE is providing a steady stream of valuable data to NASA scientists who are developing technologies for growing food crops for long-duration missions into deep space.\nYOUR CHALLENGE: The search for the perfect food plants to feed astronauts is an ongoing effort. For the past seven years, students from across the country have been helping us provide NASA scientists with data on the best candidates and innovative ideas to improve growing conditions for long-distance space travel. This year we’re exploring radishes. This promising crop produces large amounts of edible biomass (you can eat both the roots and leaves), contains valuable nutrients, and certain varieties mature quickly. Your challenge is to test an assortment of radish cultivars in Trial 1 and apply what you learn to design a second trial that optimizes the radish growing conditions to maximize yield.\nCHAT WITH A SCIENTIST: We will be hosting an OPTIONAL online chat with NASA scientists about the Growing Beyond Earth project. Teachers participating in GBE will receive an invitation a week before each chat with instructions on how to participate.

Rattlesnake rookeries are areas where females come together to give birth and care for their young. Along with their university students, the team has been studying rattlesnakes in this population for a few years, and it has become clear that these rookeries combined with modern game camera technology provide a unique opportunity to learn about rattlesnake social behavior. It is really difficult to reach areas where rattlesnakes aggregate like this, both logistically and physically, so our project has the added bonus of making this footage accessible to people from around the world.\nWe placed cameras at Prairie Rattlesnake rookeries and took photos every 5 minutes. We need your help in looking at these images and telling us whether snakes are present in each image, if so how many adult and/or baby snakes are present, and what they are doing.

Although modelization by quantum mechanics applied to chemistry has become almost mandatory in any major publication, computational raw data is most of the time kept in the labs or destroyed. Furthermore, the software used in this area tend to lack effective quality control and computational details are usually incomplete in the articles and the information may not be reused or reproduced. The first objective of this project is to constitute a large collaborative open platform that will solve and store quantum molecular chemistry results. Original output files will be available to be reused to tackle new chemical studies for different applications. Machine learning and more generally artificial intelligence applied to chemistry data promises to revolutionize this area in the near future, but these methods require a lot of data that this project will be able to provide.\nToday, it is impossible for a human to take into account the results, even limited to the most important data, for millions of known molecules. The second objective of this project is to radically change the approach developing artificial intelligence and optimization methods in order to explore efficiently the highly combinatorial molecular space. Generative models aim to provide an artificial assistant, which on the one hand has learned to predict the characteristics of a molecule and estimate its cost of synthesis, and on the other hand is able to browse effectively the molecular space. Generative models would open many perspectives by greatly facilitating the screening of new molecules with many potential applications (energy, medicine, materials, etc.). The bottleneck for our AIs is the computing power needed to verify the properties of the generated molecules.\nBy supporting this project, you will help chemical researchers around the world by building a unique collection of results. You will also help our AIs to propose much more new targets for the different applications we are addressing than we could do on our own.\nRuns on:  Linux MacOS Windows  "

Never before have we been able to map such a large part of the radio sky at such high sensitivity. This allows scientists all over the world to answer many questions on the evolution of galaxies and the supermassive black holes that they harbour.\nIn order to prepare this new data for effective research, we first need to make an inventory of everything that we are seeing. The first data-set produced by the LOFAR survey contains about 350 thousand different sources, and the second data-set will contain more than four million. This means that scientists need to process an extremely large amount of data (the equivalent of about 10 million DVDs).\nMuch of this can be done automatically using sophisticated algorithms. But to date, we have yet to develop an algorithm that is better at identifying shapes than our very own human eyes. The most complex (and therefore interesting) objects still need to be identified by people. Because of the sheer amount of sources that need to be classified, it is not realistic for scientists to do this all on their own.

With the help of BOINC, you will download a subset of compounds on your computer, examine the compounds in the context of the studied target and send the results to a server where they are collected for later analysis.\nIn our project, we are looking for ligands – small molecules that can successfully bind to protein targets and modulate a specific process that is crucial for the virus biochemistry. Based on molecular docking, the ideal ligand should be complementary in shape and properties to the binding site of the target biomolecule. However, the complementarity of small molecules is only one prerequisite for the use of a molecule as a drug.\nThe search for the right molecule is best illustrated by finding a small needle in a huge haystack. It is a much more difficult problem because of the number of possible molecular structures. The amount of all possible molecular structures is also called the chemical universe – the size of this abstract space can be estimated to be 10 to the power of 80. There are many galaxies in this chemical universe, and one of the galaxies is a galaxy with potentially pharmacologically active molecules. The method for this purpose is called virtual screening.

	"content": "Stardust@home View the project here.\nOverview On January 15, 2006, the Stardust spacecraft’s sample return capsule parachuted gently onto the Utah desert. Nestled within the capsule were precious particles collected during Stardust’s dramatic encounter with comet Wild 2 in January of 2004; and something else, even rarer and no less precious: tiny particles of interstellar dust that originated in distant stars, light-years away. They are the first such contemporary interstellar dust particles ever collected in space and returned to Earth for study.\nBefore they can be studied, though, these tiny interstellar grains have to be found. As we have discovered since we started the Stardust@home project in 2006, this is not easy. Unlike the thousands of particles of varying sizes collected from the comet, scientists originally estimated that Stardust would collect only around 45 interstellar dust particles. After a thorough search of about one-third of the collector, we have so far found only four particles that appear to be interstellar. So they are incredibly rare and precious. They are tiny only about a micron (a millionth of a meter) in size! These miniscule particles are embedded in an aerogel collector 1,000 square centimeters in size. To make things worse the collector plates are interspersed with flaws, cracks, and an uneven surface. All this makes the interstellar dust particles extremely difficult to locate.\nIf we were doing this project twenty years ago, we would have searched for the tracks through a typical laboratory microscope of the era. Because the view of the microscope is so small, we would have had to move the microscope more than 1.6 million times to search the whole collector. And in each field of view, we would have had to focus up and down by hand to look for the tracks. This is so much work, that even starting twenty years ago, we would still be doing it today!\nSince we cannot do this by ourselves, we are asking for help from talented volunteers like you from all over the world. Of course, we can’t invite hundreds of people to our lab to do this search-we only have two microscopes! To find the elusive particles , therefore, we are using an automated scanning microscope to automatically collect images of the entire Stardust interstellar collector at the Curatorial Facility at Johnson Space Center in Houston. We call these stacks of images focus movies. All in all there will be nearly a million such focus movies. These are available to Stardust@home users like you around the world. You can then view them with the aid of a specialVirtual Microscope (VM) that works in your web browser.\nTogether, you and thousands of other Stardust@home participants will find the first pristine interstellar dust particles ever brought to Earth.\nLocation: Online\n"

	"content": "Stardust@home View the project here.\nOverview The interstellar dust particles returned to Earth by the Stardust mission are the first such pristine dust particles ever collected in space, and scientists are eager to “get their hands” on them. We estimate that Stardust collected less than 100 interstellar dust particles. They are tiny-only about a micron (a millionth of a meter) in size! These miniscule particles were captured in an aerogel collector about 1,000 square centimeters in size, and in about 150 square centimeters of aluminum metal foils. Finding them is something like searching for a handful of ants on a football field while searching one 5 cm x 5 cm square at a time.\nBy asking for help from talented volunteers like you from all over the world, we can do this project in a lot less time than it would take a handful of scientists and lab technicians to do alone. To find the tiny particles we are using two methods. Together, you and thousands of other Stardust@home participants will find the first pristine interstellar dust particles ever brought to Earth.\nThe search will take several years to complete. Our automated microscope at the Johnson Space Center can scan about one tile of aerogel from the Stardust interstellar dust collector tray per day. There are 130 tiles in total. We may have false starts (in fact, we already have), where we discover a problem and have to rescan one or more tiles. For example, once we find a dust track, we may decide to change the lighting conditions or the scanning parameters so that the scans are better. Please be patient with us!\nIn recognition of the critical importance of the Stardust@home volunteers, the discoverer of an interstellar dust particle appears as a co-author on any scientific paper by the Stardust@home team announcing the discovery of the particle. The discoverer also has the privilege of naming the particle! Each particle, as it is discovered, will be given some kind of alpha-numeric identifier (an address of sorts) for book-keeping purposes. But the name that people will actually call each particle will be given to it by its discoverer. For example, Bruce Hudson of Ontario, Canada, discovered our first candidate interstellar dust track. Its official NASA “phone number” is “I1043,1,30,0,0” – which is very hard to remember and doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue. So we asked Bruce to give it a name to publish it by, and he decided on “Orion”, and then later “Sirius” for the accompanying upstream particle that was discovered very nearby. Bruce was featured in a recent article in Nature on Citizen Science projects. To also recognize the efforts of our volunteers who work hard, but may not have found a particle, we will invite the top-ranked volunteers to come visit our lab in Berkeley for a special tour. (Unfortunately, we are legally precluded from covering travel expenses.)\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

For example, some researchers analyze MRI images to study the brain. But before they start the analysis, they have to visually inspect each image to make sure it is good quality. And at various stages in data processing, researchers have to check images to make sure the analysis is correct. This can get really unweildy when we have large datasets, which are needed to really understand the brain. Citizen science games like EyeWire have been really successful for brain analysis, but it is built for one specific type of data, and its really hard to adapt for a different use-case. Researchers need a way to easily spin up a citizen science game for their own large datasets, ideally without needing to know web-development (so they can focus on research!)  The solution\nThe SwipesForScience game template will:\n Generate a game from a configuration file provided by a researcher The game should be easy to deploy online, and require very little knowledge of web technologies/cloud technologies Be fun and easy for citizen scientists to use  We need expertise in app development, user experience design, database maintenance, software sustainability, documentation, technical writing, and project management.\nOur primary goal is to make it extremely easy for researchers to set up their own data-annotation game. This means that we need to simplify the dev-ops parts of setup, and we need very clear documentation. We also want to design annotation widgets that are easy and fun to use, so that citizen scientists enjoy playing these games.\nIf you think you can help in any of the areas listed above (and we bet you can) or in any of the many areas that we haven\u0026rsquo;t yet thought of (and here we\u0026rsquo;re sure you can) then please check out our contributors' guidelines and our roadmap.\nLocation: Online\n"

Cataloguers and museum staff create metadata based on standards and rules.

Timber prices are skyrocketing and a black walnut tree can be worth $50,000, making them especially attractive to thieves. This impressive species is a critical part of the canopy as well as a valuable food source for fox squirrels and other creatures. It\u0026rsquo;s well worth protecting.\nThe species has been cloned and planted across the world, so your backcountry skills are especially needed to take samples from wild trees on public lands. Those samples will become the basis of chemical and DNA databases that law enforcement can use to prosecute timber thieves.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re collecting thousands of leaf, seed, and wood samples to create databases of the chemical and genetic signatures of tree species throughout their ranges. This information will power new tools to reveal the origin of any sample of timber––taking away illegal loggers' ability to sneak poached trees into the world\u0026rsquo;s wood supply.\nSample collection for eastern black walnut will kick off in July 2021. Data collection will take place on public lands (forests, refuges, reserves) throughout the Eastern black walnut range in the US. These trees grow from western Connecticut and Massachusetts to the coast of North Carolina, from Georgia and west until eastern Texas, north through Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska, and across the southern regions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York.\nOnce collected, our samples will undergo two forms of processing: Mass Spectrometry-Data Analysis in Real Time (MS-DART or DART) and genetic analysis.\nWe are seeking adventurous individuals who will follow detailed protocols, communicate regularly with the Adventure Scientists team, and follow through on their commitments in a timely matter.\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

In order to do this you have to be able to identify a red maple. We are currently putting together a guide on how to identify maple species. In particular, the guide will focus on differentiating red maple (Acer rubrum) from other maples such as silver maple (Acer saccharinum) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) – stay tuned!\nIn addition to providing the leaf samples, citizen scientists will also fill out a form to provide more information about the particular tree and ecosystem from which they sampled.\nLocation: Outdoors\n"

Funded by the National Science Foundation, and in collaboration with Open Humans, we investigate how to design effective interaction techniques to empower nonexpert users to engage with and make sense of their personal omic information. We also explore how user interface design interventions in online consent forms can support informed decision and enable participants of biomedical research to make decisions that are right for them.\nDo you have microbiome data?\nHelp us understand how to help people capture, visualize, and engage with their microbiome data. At this stage of the project, we seek to better understand people’s needs and practices as they engage with their personal microbiome data. The long-term goal of this project is to design more novel interactive tools that promote exploration, collaborative sense-making, sharing, and citizen science initiatives related to genetics and microbiome data.\nAfter joining this project, we will ask you to answer a questionnaire about your experience engaging with your personal microbiome data.

Our knowledge grows faster than ever before. We explore the structures of the Universe, nuclei of stars and evolution of galaxies. Using the strength of our minds we crack problems that are not tangible and cannot be examined in laboratory. The technology came as an aid in this struggle. The computers help us to calculate complicated problems and to model extraordinary objects. Therefore the need for computational power is growing exponentially in the scientists' community.\nIn a different situation are millions of people around the world. The computers industry is evolving extremely quickly and personal computers are available for constantly decreasing prises. Simultaneously, these machines must be strong enough to fulfil the growing needs of users who want to play the newest games and use resources-demanding programs. However, most of the time such computers spend in the idle state when they are used for simple web-browsing or document-writing. The most of computational power stays unused.\nAs a remedy to both these issues have came the BOINC platform. The innovative infrastructure, which, from one side, serves as the source of huge computational power, and from the other side, gives people the possibility to become involved in huge contemporary science projects utilising their limited resources. BOINC stands for Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing. This system was used for the first time in year 1999 and afterwards dozens of other projects have came into existence. In 2014 the time came for adopting this idea in polish astronomy projects and, at first, the fundamental problems of the stellar evolution will be solved.\nRuns on:  Linux MacOS Windows  "

This project aims to investigate humpback songs from different years and regions, to identify humpback whale sounds in recordings, to classify these calls or units, and eventually to see if we can find individually distinct calls or units (the same way we do in Manatee Chat). This information will be used to train deep learning models that will be able to identify humpback whale sounds in recordings, to classify calls, and to search for underlying structure, hopefully allowing better understanding of the song’s function. If it is possible to identify individually distinct calls, then this information could be used to track migrating whales acoustically, helping to get valuable information about humpback whale populations and their health.\nBased on both currently running projects, Dolphin Chat and Manatee Chat, we will be offering additional training and practice for citizen scientists.

Urbanization poses many threats to wildlife such as loss of habitat, fragmentation of habitat, roads and traffic, poisons and toxins, people, and our pets. This project is striving to collect information that can be used by city planners to help them make educated decisions about wildlife when planning future developments.\nThe Santa Monica Mountains Fund (SAMO Fund), a non-profit partner in conjunction with the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation area is conducting a study to identify a variety of wildlife at varying levels of urbanization: The photographs on this project were taken from camera traps placed at urban and natural park sites, golf courses, and small undeveloped patches within urban areas in and around Los Angeles.\nLos Angeles is the second most populous city in the country, and has a diverse suite of species ranging from mountain lions, including the famous P22, to coyotes, gray foxes, bobcats, raccoons, skunks, opossums, etc\u0026hellip; We know that there are a wide variety of species around Los Angeles, but little is known about the animals that live with the 3.9 million people in the city of LA.\nThe goal of this project using data collected through a partnership between SAMOFUND and the National Park Service is to work with partner agencies to leverage the information to improve conservation through out Los Angeles.
