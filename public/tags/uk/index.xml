      <description>Voices Through Time: The Story of Care View the project here.
Overview Help us transcribe the records of Coram, the UK’s first children’s charity, to tell the story of care from where it began.
Our archive contains thousands of handwritten records, going back to the 1700s, which contain the stories of children who were cared for at the Foundling Hospital.
With your help transcribing these records, we can make them available online for the first time.</description>
