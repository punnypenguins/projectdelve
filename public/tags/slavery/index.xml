Overview Agents of Enslavement? is a research project, which seeks to explore the ways in which colonial newspapers in the Caribbean facilitated and challenged the practice of slavery.
It also seeks to identify the networks and voices of enslaved people hidden within these newspapers.
These crowdsourcing tasks are integral to both these aims as your help will create new datasets for analysis.
One of the goals of this project is to create a database of enslaved people identified within these newspapers.</description>
