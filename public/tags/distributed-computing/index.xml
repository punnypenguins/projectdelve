      <title>Africa Rainfall Project</title>

      <description>Africa Rainfall Project View the project here.
Overview In sub-Saharan Africa, 95 percent of agriculture depends on rainfall, which makes accurate weather forecasts absolutely crucial. However, because rainfall in this area is often localized—sometimes almost at the level of one farm—it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to forecast accurately with satellite data, which show larger weather patterns.
Through the Africa Rainfall Project, researchers at Delft University of Technology will create high-resolution computer simulations of localized rainstorms in sub-Saharan Africa.</description>

      <description>Amicable Pairs View the project here.
Overview Though mathematics is not an experimental science, mathematicians often look for examples to test conjectures (which they then hope to prove). As the number of examples increases, so does (in a sense) their understanding of the distribution.
The goal is to collect all amicable numbers up to a very large limit. This data will facilitate theoretical research in the field: 1, 2, 3 to name a few examples.</description>

Overview The enormous size of the diagonal Latin squares space makes it unfeasible to enumerate all its objects straightforwardly in reasonable time. So, in order to discover the structure of this space, sophisticated search methods are needed. In RakeSearch project, we implement an application that picks up separate pairs of mutually orthogonal DLSs, which allows to reconstruct full graphs of their orthogonality.

You help by installing BOINC, a free program that runs scientific jobs in the background and when you&amp;rsquo;re not using the computer. BOINC is secure and will not affect your normal use of the computer.</description>

      <description>SiDock@home View the project here.
Overview Sidock@home is an international volunteer computing project aimed at drug discovery. The first mission of the project is discovery of possible drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It started as an extension of the project COVID.SI to engage the BOINC community into the drug discovery.
You can help with your computer. With the help of BOINC, you will download a subset of compounds on your computer, examine the compounds in the context of the studied target and send the results to a server where they are collected for later analysis.</description>

      <description>Smash Childhood Cancer View the project here.
Overview In the past 20 years, only a small number of new drugs designed to treat childhood cancer have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Half of all the chemotherapy treatments used for children with cancer have been in existence for 25 years or longer.
Members of the Smash Childhood Cancer research team have identified proteins and other molecules that play key roles in certain childhood cancers.</description>

      <description>Universe@home View the project here.
Overview Universe@home project&amp;rsquo;s two main goals are:
 to provide scientist with a necessary computational power and to provide the way of involvement for anyone equipped with a computer and willing to take part in the research  We live in times which are marked by the fastest scientific development in the history. Our knowledge grows faster than ever before. We explore the structures of the Universe, nuclei of stars and evolution of galaxies.</description>

      <description>World Community Grid View the project here.
Overview Donate your device’s spare computing power to help scientists solve the world’s biggest problems.
As a World Community Grid volunteer, your device does research calculations when it has spare power. With your help, scientists can identify the most important results to study in the lab, bringing them one step closer to discoveries that save lives and address global problems.

      <description>ОДЛК View the project here.
Overview В проекте составляется база данных канонических форм (КФ) диагональных латинских квадратов (ДЛК) 10-го порядка, имеющих ортогональные диагональные латинские квадраты (ОДЛК). Необходимые определения по теме можно найти здесь:
Первые три ортогональные пары ДЛК были найдены в 1992 году, они опубликованы в статье “Completion of the Spectrum of Orthogonal Diagonal Latin Squares” (J. W. Brown и другие).
В 2012-2016 гг. действовал научный BOINC-проект SAT@home, в котором искались новые ортогональные пары ДЛК 10-го порядка.</description>
