      <description>New Particle Search at CERN View the project here.
Overview You have the opportunity to contribute to the search for undiscovered particles, which are produced from the collisions of high-energy protons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the worldâ€™s most powerful particle accelerator.
While the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012, after about 40 years of intense experimental and theoretical research, and was the last missing component of our present model of particle physics, there are still many unanswered questions and even more theories that try to answer them.</description>

      <description>Radioactive@Home View the project here.
Overview Radioactive@Home is a polish science project using distributed computing capabilities of BOINC platform. The main goal of the project is to create free and constantly updated map of radiation available for all people, by gathering information about gamma radiation using using sensors connected to computers of volunteers willing to participate in the project. The project uses dedicated hardware sensor; without it the app does nothing and no credits are granted.</description>
