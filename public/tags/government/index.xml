      <description>Beyond Borders: Transcribing Historic Maine Land Documents View the project here.
Overview Help turn our collection of 17th-19th century handwritten documents relating to Maine&amp;rsquo;s land history into text that may be more easily read, keyword searchable, and accessed by students, teachers, and historians.
Maine Historical Society received a grant in the summer of 2020 from the National Endowment for the Humanities to fully digitized three significant land collections covering 1625-1893. In addition to digitization, Maine Historical is making an effort to transcribe these collections for easier access to their historic content.</description>

      <description>Papers of the War Department View the project here.
Overview The War Department office was established in 1790. It burned in 1800.
For decades historians believed that its files, and the window they provide into the early federal government, had been lost forever. This collection unites copies of the lost files in a digital archive that reconstitutes this invaluable historical resource. Our community of transcribers are working to create full text transcriptions of every possible document in the collection.</description>
