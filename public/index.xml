      <description>What is accessibility? While most of what you find in a quick Google search for &amp;ldquo;accessibility&amp;rdquo; is about website and application accessibility for disabled users, accessibility is a lot broader than that.
Accessibility for the disabled community covers everything—physical access, internet sites, technology, education, jobs, etc., which is already much bigger than simply accessible website design and accessibility settings on phones and other technology.
Accessibility for everyone encompasses all of those things for all populations within our society.</description>

      <description>Inequality is real, current, and worsening across the U.S. And despite those truths, we tend to be absolutely terrible at recognizing it in our modern lives.
Research participants consistently underestimate the extent of modern inequality across the board. So before we look at how Project Delve works to mitigate a tiny part of it, we first need to make sure we understand the problem itself.</description>

SuperWASP: Black Hole Hunters View the project here.
Overview SuperWASP is the Wide Angle Search for Planets; due to the combination of sky coverage (all latitudes above and below the Galactic plane), observing cadence (how regularly each star is observed) and long temporal baseline (the overall lengths of the lightcurves for each star) the archive is the ideal place to start searching for periodic lensing on the timescales of hours to years.</description>

      <description>Active Asteroids View the project here.
Overview Active Asteroids &amp;ndash; asteroids with comet-like activity such as tails &amp;ndash; are poorly understood in part because so few of these objects have been found. At the time of this project launch, fewer than 30 active asteroids have been found since 1949. Finding more active asteroids will enable scientists to study these enigmatic objects as a population. The implications for science and engineering are far-reaching, including:</description>

      <description>Africa Rainfall Project View the project here.
Overview In sub-Saharan Africa, 95 percent of agriculture depends on rainfall, which makes accurate weather forecasts absolutely crucial. However, because rainfall in this area is often localized—sometimes almost at the level of one farm—it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to forecast accurately with satellite data, which show larger weather patterns.
Through the Africa Rainfall Project, researchers at Delft University of Technology will create high-resolution computer simulations of localized rainstorms in sub-Saharan Africa.</description>

      <description>Amicable Pairs View the project here.
Overview Though mathematics is not an experimental science, mathematicians often look for examples to test conjectures (which they then hope to prove). As the number of examples increases, so does (in a sense) their understanding of the distribution.
The goal is to collect all amicable numbers up to a very large limit. This data will facilitate theoretical research in the field: 1, 2, 3 to name a few examples.</description>

Overview Studies of human evolution often focus on the fossils and artifacts left by our early ancestors. However, we can also make inferences about human origins by studying our closest living relatives: chimpanzees, the great apes that live across equatorial Africa. Because humans and chimps are so closely related, patterns in chimpanzee behavior may tell us quite a bit about how the earliest hominids lived and evolved.</description>

Overview In order to study a disease, we need to know what it looks like. When it comes to endometriosis, there are many different ways in which the disease can present itself in patients. There is a disconnect between how doctors think about the disease and what patients experience on a daily basis. Bridging this gap is critical to further research on endometriosis. Citizen Endo will use a series of studies to better understand the disease from the perspective of patients.</description>

      <description>Dental Disease Detection View the project here.
Overview Dental radiography is an essential tool for diagnostics of dental diseases. Analysis of radiographs is time-consuming and often error-prone due to a high variety of dental structures, positioning/orientation errors, and the substantial amount of radiographs that need to be analysed. An automatic solution for flagging abnormalities in dental radiographs is needed to improve detection accuracy and to reduce the cost of misdiagnosis. This project aims to use AI to bridge this gap to find and validate such a solution, by building a software prototype enabling computers to recognise normal anatomical structures and differentiate from subtle abnormalities in radiographs.</description>

Overview Welcome to Floating Forests, where you can help us uncover the history of Giant Kelp forests around the globe. Most life on the seafloor can only be sampled by SCUBA divers or dredging up samples from the deep. This kind of data requires a ton of (really fun) effort to collect, but it means we’re limited to places we can get to! Given the worldwide distribution of kelp, we need your help to track it across time and space.</description>

Overview SELECTIVE PROJECT. Strict requirements.
Mexico’s Pacific Coast is home to some of the world’s most biodiverse coral reefs, underwater communities that support sharks, turtles, and other marine life. They also support human lives by buffering the coastline from intense storms and providing livelihoods from fishing and tourism. Yet these reefs are imperiled by ocean acidification, more frequent and powerful storms due to climate change, and damage from human overuse.</description>

Soaring from Mexico into the United States and Canada, monarch butterflies are searching for one thing: milkweed plants. Monarch butterflies are beautiful, charismatic insects known for their long-distance migration and their reliance on milkweeds (Asclepias species). Milkweeds are the only plants on which monarchs lay their eggs. After the eggs hatch, the caterpillars, also called larvae, eat milkweed leaves to grow.</description>

Overview Natural history collections house over a billion insect specimens worldwide collected over several centuries. Specimen labels encode data denoting species, location, and date captured and are used to study biogeographic patterns, spread of invasive species, and responses to land use, climate, and other environmental changes. However, access to data is impractical for most of the research community.
Because of enormous collection sizes, entomology has lagged behind other disciplines in digitizing collections.</description>

Overview Parasitic arthropods inflict an enormous burden on human society; they afflict human health and the animals on which we depend. The negative effects of parasitic arthropods are exacerbated by current climate and ecosystem change. Fleas that vectored the pathogen causing bubonic plague wreaked havoc on historic human populations. Mosquitos continue to vector pathogens responsible for malaria and dengue, and ticks vector the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease; these arthropod borne pathogens infect and kill millions of people each year.</description>

Overview COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV2, a virus of the coronavirus family. These viruses cause diseases that affect mainly the human respiratory system and potentially other major organs. COVID-19 can lead to serious illness or even death.
As of the launch of this project, there is no treatment, cure, or vaccine for COVID-19.
Scientists at Scripps Research are doing molecular modeling simulations to look for possible candidates for the development of treatments for COVID-19, but to be successful they need massive computing power to carry out millions of simulated laboratory experiments.</description>

Overview Research Question: How is climate change affecting plant phenology?
Help us understand how plants are responding to this year&amp;rsquo;s seasons and longer-term changes in climate.
How plants react to seasonal change has a big impact on the environment. Because plants are at the base of the food chain, anything that affects plants can impact other parts of the ecosystem. Phenology is important because it affects plants ability to produce fruits and seeds and food availability for other animals like birds and squirrels.</description>

Overview NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission will take pictures of more than a million stars to search for planets orbiting them, called &amp;ldquo;transiting exoplanets&amp;rdquo;. We expect this mission will see thousands of these transiting exoplanets when they pass in front of nearby stars and periodically block some of the starlight.
But sometimes when a star dims like that, it&amp;rsquo;s not because of a planet.</description>

      <description>RakeSearch View the project here.
Overview The enormous size of the diagonal Latin squares space makes it unfeasible to enumerate all its objects straightforwardly in reasonable time. So, in order to discover the structure of this space, sophisticated search methods are needed. In RakeSearch project, we implement an application that picks up separate pairs of mutually orthogonal DLSs, which allows to reconstruct full graphs of their orthogonality.

Overview The interstellar dust particles returned to Earth by the Stardust mission are the first such pristine dust particles ever collected in space, and scientists are eager to “get their hands” on them. We estimate that Stardust collected less than 100 interstellar dust particles. They are tiny-only about a micron (a millionth of a meter) in size! These miniscule particles were captured in an aerogel collector about 1,000 square centimeters in size, and in about 150 square centimeters of aluminum metal foils.</description>

Overview The problem
 Big data in biomedical research needs individual inspection, but this doesn’t scale for large datasets. For example, some researchers analyze MRI images to study the brain. But before they start the analysis, they have to visually inspect each image to make sure it is good quality. And at various stages in data processing, researchers have to check images to make sure the analysis is correct.</description>

Overview With climate change, drought conditions are becoming more frequent and severe in Australia. Greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis), like many other species, are sensitive to drought. To combat this conservation challenge, we need to think of creative solutions to support threatened species, such as the bilby, during drought.
In 2019, research collaborators at the University of New South Wales and the Taronga Conservation Society Australia released bilbies into a 110-ha semi-wild sanctuary at Taronga Western Plains Zoo, in Dubbo, NSW, for conservation breeding and release.</description>

      <description>ОДЛК View the project here.
Overview В проекте составляется база данных канонических форм (КФ) диагональных латинских квадратов (ДЛК) 10-го порядка, имеющих ортогональные диагональные латинские квадраты (ОДЛК). Необходимые определения по теме можно найти здесь:
Первые три ортогональные пары ДЛК были найдены в 1992 году, они опубликованы в статье “Completion of the Spectrum of Orthogonal Diagonal Latin Squares” (J. W. Brown и другие).
В 2012-2016 гг. действовал научный BOINC-проект SAT@home, в котором искались новые ортогональные пары ДЛК 10-го порядка.</description>
