## New York Public Library: What's on the menu?

View the project [**here**](http://menus.nypl.org/).

### Overview

Help The New York Public Library improve a unique collection!

We’re transcribing our historical restaurant menus, dish by dish, so that they can be searched by what people were eating back in the day. It’s a big job so we need your help!
