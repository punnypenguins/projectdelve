### Overview

Travel back in time and take a behind-the-scenes look at the stories, lives and interactions of WWI-era staff and soldiers at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, one of London’s most iconic and longstanding institutions.

Named for the colours of the coats worn by England’s famous Chelsea Pensioners, the Scarlets and Blues project takes a behind-the-scenes look at the Royal Hospital Chelsea using records from The National Archives.

Help us transcribe the meeting notes of one of London’s most iconic institutions, revealing little-known data related to the lives of hospital staff and soldiers in England during the era of the First World War.
