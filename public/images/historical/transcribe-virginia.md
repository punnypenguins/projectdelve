## Transcribe

View the project [**here**](https://www.virginiamemory.com/transcribe/).

### Overview

**_Transcribe_** is the Library of Virginia’s collaborative online workspace where the public can participate in enhancing access to many of our amazing collections documenting over 400 years of Virginia history, people, and culture. This is the perfect opportunity for participants to dig deep into our collections and transcribe historical materials from five to ten active projects at a time. From peace to wartime, court records to letters home, and conspiracies to political statements, there will be something for everyone.

Crowdsourcing empowers communities to make their own history; the Library – leveraging advancements in open source transcription tools and projects developed by our peers – supports this empowerment by inviting the public to be our partners in making our collections more visible and more accessible. Help us tell the narrative of all Virginians – the famous, infamous and even anonymous – and join us in Making History.
