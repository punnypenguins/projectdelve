## Every Name Counts

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/arolsen-archives/every-name-counts).

### Overview

With the initiative #everynamecounts, the Arolsen Archives aim to establish a digital memorial to the people persecuted by the Nazis. Future generations should be able to remember the names and identities of the victims and put faces to history.

Thousands of volunteers are contributing to this first major digital memorial, which will enable people all over the world to access and search the data themselves. This is invaluable to researchers and teachers – and to the families of the victims.

We are using our collections to create the world's largest [Online Archive](https://collections.arolsen-archives.org/en/search/) of documents on the victims and survivors of National Socialism – which will be a digital memorial to the people who were persecuted. This is a huge task, so we need your help. Our archive contains around **30 million documents** with references to the fates of **17.5 million people.**

Many millions of names can already be easily searched, but not nearly all of them. This is why we launched the # everynamecounts crowdsourcing project. You can help us transcribe information from our historical documents, such as names and birth dates.
