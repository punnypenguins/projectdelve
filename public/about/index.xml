      <description>Project Delve is nice and simple. All content is viewable from one single menu, so you can&amp;rsquo;t get lost.
Sidebar/Menu Sections If you&amp;rsquo;re using a desktop computer, you will see a blue sidebar on the left side of your screen. If you&amp;rsquo;re on mobile, this sidebar will be tucked into a drop-down menu, which you can find by clicking the symbol with three horizontal lines in the top left corner of your device&amp;rsquo;s screen.</description>

      <description>As all scientists learn, one of the most important things when sharing work with others is to be transparent about your sources, methods, and evidence. Here are mine.
Hub websites you can sign up on to help with (and keep track of) a lot of volunteer science projects at once:  Zooniverse - The worldâ€™s largest and most popular platform for people-powered research. World Community Grid - Donate your deviceâ€™s spare computing power to help scientists solve the worldâ€™s biggest problems in health and sustainability.</description>
