      <description>If you notice any typos, know a project that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been added yet, or have suggestions for the website, email me with all the relevant information and I&amp;rsquo;ll get back with you as soon as I can.
When I have more time, I&amp;rsquo;ll add a section on this page giving instructions on how to contribute edits and new entries on your own via GitHub pull requests.</description>

      <description>As all scientists learn, one of the most important things when sharing work with others is to be transparent about your sources, methods, and evidence. Here are mine.
Hub websites you can sign up on to help with (and keep track of) a lot of volunteer science projects at once:  Zooniverse - The world’s largest and most popular platform for people-powered research. World Community Grid - Donate your device’s spare computing power to help scientists solve the world’s biggest problems in health and sustainability.</description>
