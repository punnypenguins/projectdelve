As all scientists learn, one of the most important things when sharing work with others is to be transparent about your sources, methods, and evidence. Here are mine.

## Hub websites you can sign up on to help with (and keep track of) a lot of volunteer science projects at once:
- [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/about) - The world’s largest and most popular platform for people-powered research.
- [World Community Grid](https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/discover.action#introduction) - Donate your device’s spare computing power to help scientists solve the world’s biggest problems in health and sustainability.
- [From the Page](https://www.fromthepage.com/findaproject) - Help transcribe lots of historical records in all kinds of record/object collctions.
- [Citizen Archivist Dashboard](https://www.archives.gov/citizen-archivist/missions) - Help the U.S. National Archives by tagging and transcribing all kinds of different projects.
- [CitSci 2.0](https://citsci.org/) - Another large hub for a broad spread of ongoing citizen science projects.
- [BudBurst](https://budburst.org/) - BudBurst has multiple ongoing projects trying to tackle current ecology questions and challenges.

## Other sources I've pulled from:
- [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/projects.php) - BOINC is the backbone of many volunteer computing projects.
- [Society for Science](https://www.societyforscience.org/research-at-home/citizen-science/) - Society for Science is "a champion for science, dedicated to expanding scientific literacy, effective STEM education and scientific research.""
- [r/CitizenScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitizenScience/) - The subreddit dedicated to citizen science. Small, and not particularly active, but could grow in the future.
- [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/idea/citizen-science-projects/) - This page on their website has several good citizen science projects linked in different subject areas.
- [NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/citizenscience) - They've listed all of their citizen science opportunities in one handy place.
- [CitizenScience.gov](https://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/#) - Every single citizen science project from any USA government agency in the country is listed on their website.
- [CitizenScience.gov](https://www.citizenscience.gov/#) - The U.S. federal government's website "designed to accelerate the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science across the U.S. government."
- [DistributedComputing.info](https://www.distributedcomputing.info/) - This website is definitely not up to date, but did have just a few projects that were still active, so I'm including it here for transparency.
- Members of the St. Louis Genealogical Society
- This GitHub topic search for [`citizen-science`](https://github.com/topics/citizen-science)
- [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/) - This is their page that lists a huge number of citizen science projects.
- [Digital Tools for Citizen Science](https://github.com/dylanrees/citizen-science) - Dylan's "repository of resources related to citizen, community-based and/or non-institutional science."
- Wikepedia's page on [BioBlitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioBlitz) - "A BioBlitz, also written without capitals as bioblitz, is an intense period of biological surveying in an attempt to record all the living species within a designated area."
