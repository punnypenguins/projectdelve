## Contribute via GitHub

ðŸŒŸ If you're new to using GitHub, I have a guide just for you [**written here**](https://github.com/punnypenguins/projectdelve/blob/main/documentation/for-beginner-contributers.md)!

## Donate

I'm not trying to make any profit off this site, but it does cost bit of money to host it and purchase the domain name. If you feel like helping out with the site maintenance costs, or just want to toss me a little thank-you tip, you can do so over on my [**Ko-fi page**](https://ko-fi.com/punnypenguins).
