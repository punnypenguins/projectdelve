## Science United

View the project [**here**](https://scienceunited.org/).

### Overview

Science United lets you help scientific research projects by giving them computing power. These projects do research in astronomy, physics, biomedicine, mathematics, and environmental science; you can pick the areas you want to support.

You help by installing BOINC, a free program that runs scientific jobs in the background and when you're not using the computer. BOINC is secure and will not affect your normal use of the computer.

BOINC is the preeminent platform for volunteer computing (VC). It is used by most VC projects, including SETI@home, Einstein@home, Climateprediction.net, IBM World Community Grid, and Rosetta@home.

Science United is a new way to participate in BOINC. With Science United, computer owners volunteer for science areas rather than for specific projects. Science United assigns computers to appropriate projects; these assignments may change over time.

We call this the 'coordinated model' for VC. It has the advantage that new projects can get computing power without having to do their own publicity and volunteer recruitment. The goal is to provide the power of VC to thousands of scientists, rather than a few dozen as was previously the case.

The user interface of Science United is designed to appeal to a wider audience than the current BOINC user base, which is mostly male and tech-savvy. For example, Science United has no leader boards.
