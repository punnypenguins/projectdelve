### Overview

**NOTE:** When viewing the catalog page, make sure you set the `View by Status` filter to only "Active" projects!

CitizenScience.gov is an official government website designed to accelerate the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science across the U.S. government. The site provides a portal to three key components: a [catalog](https://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/) of federally supported citizen science projects, a [toolkit](https://www.citizenscience.gov/toolkit) to assist federal practitioners with designing and maintaining their projects, and a [gateway to a community](https://www.citizenscience.gov/about/community-of-practice/) of hundreds of citizen science practitioners and coordinators across government as called for in the [Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act of 2016](http://bit.ly/2BlulAG) (15 USC 3724).
