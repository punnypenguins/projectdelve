## Zooniverse

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/).

### Overview

**NOTE:** *As of November 2021, ALL active projects listed on Zooniverse are listed on this website in individual entries. New projects are added to Zooniverse intermittently, however, and sometimes their "Paused" projects turn active again, so it's worth checking Zooniverse on occasion to see if there is anything new.*

The Zooniverse is the world’s largest and most popular platform for people-powered research. This research is made possible by volunteers — more than a million people around the world who come together to assist professional researchers. Our goal is to enable research that would not be possible, or practical, otherwise. Zooniverse research results in new discoveries, datasets useful to the wider research community, and [many publications](https://www.zooniverse.org/about/publications).
