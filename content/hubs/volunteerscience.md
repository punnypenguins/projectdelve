## Volunteer Science

View the project [**here**](https://volunteerscience.com/experiments/).

### Overview

NOTE: This is a hub website, not a volunteer project itself.

Volunteer Science is a platform for creating online labs. Individual researchers can create unlimited online studies and recruit unlimited participants from anywhere around the world. Research labs can create research teams, giving all their members access to lab experiments and data. Large research organizations like universities, government agencies, and private companies can provide their research teams with organization-specific behavioral lab facilities connecting to internal- and external-facing audiences and subject pools.

We welcome participants from around the world. However, you will need to be 18 years or older in order to provide consent to donate your data for research.
