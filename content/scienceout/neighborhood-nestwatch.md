## Neighborhood Nestwatch

### Overview

This Smithsonian citizen science program provides an outdoor educational experience for backyard wildlife enthusiasts and underserved youth. Participants contribute to important scientific research by re-sighting banded birds and monitoring nests. The Neighborhood Nestwatch approach features face-to-face interaction on an annual basis between Smithsonian scientists, participants and neighborhood birds. The program takes place in metro-area backyards, as well as at under-resourced schools in cities throughout the U.S.

Accessing private properties in the course of urban ecology studies can be a major obstacle. Neighborhood Nestwatch overcomes this through its "house-call" approach, where each backyard or schoolyard involved becomes an outdoor classroom and research site. Participants are not only inspired to learn about local wildlife, but are also mentored to become citizen scientists in their own neighborhoods.

Nestwatch focuses on two basic life-history traits: annual survival and reproductive success. During an annual site visit, where scientists visit participants, birds are temporarily captured and then released. Their measurements are taken, a unique combination of color bands are placed on their legs and their nests are located. The colored bands allow participants to easily recognize a bird that returns to the yard.

After a site visit, participants keep track of the birds they re-sight. The data they collect reflects how long a bird lived in their yard and the surrounding area. Data recorded about a bird's nest sheds light on how well birds are able to reproduce within an area. By submitting their observations, participants help Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center scientists understand how successfully different species are surviving across a range of environments that are impacted by people.e Natural History Museum website.
