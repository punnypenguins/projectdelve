## PROJECT NAME

View the project [**here**](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam).

### Overview

We’re calling all amateur astronomers to upload their telescopic images and data of Jupiter. These uploads are critical for providing context for new JunoCam images and will help NASA successfully plan the future of the mission.

If you're a veteran astrophotographer or if you're just getting started with your first telescope, we highly recommend you read our [Submission Guidelines](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/pub/e/downloads/JUNOCAM_instructions.pdf) before submitting data. In the PDF you'll find information about the best capture and process workflows as well as links to free software and tutorials.

There is also a section for image processing:

> *This is where we will post raw images. We invite you to download them, do your own image processing, and we encourage you to upload your creations for us to enjoy and share.  The types of image processing we’d love to see range from simply cropping an image to highlighting a particular atmospheric feature, as well as adding your own color enhancements, creating collages and adding advanced color reconstruction.*
