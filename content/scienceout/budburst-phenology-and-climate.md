## Phenology and Climate

View the project [**here**](https://budburst.org/phenology-and-climate).

### Overview

**Research Question:** *How is climate change affecting plant phenology?*

Help us understand how plants are responding to this year's seasons and longer-term changes in climate.

How plants react to seasonal change has a big impact on the environment. Because plants are at the base of the food chain, anything that affects plants can impact other parts of the ecosystem. Phenology is important because it affects plants ability to produce fruits and seeds and food availability for other animals like birds and squirrels. It is important to humans because our food supply depends on plants blooming when pollinators are available. And, to scientists, changes in the timing of phenological events can be used as indicators of changing climates.

**Challenges:**
- [Fall into Phenology](https://budburst.org/fall-into-phenology) - What autumn changes do you notice in the plants in your neighborhood, schoolyard, or community?
- [Summer Solstice Snapshot](https://budburst.org/summer-solstice-snapshot) - In the heat of summer it can feel as though everything slows down, but the plants around you are still changing.
- [Cherry Blossom Blitz](https://budburst.org/cherry-blossom-blitz) - In many parts of the country, the arrival of cherry blossoms is a sure sign that spring is here.
