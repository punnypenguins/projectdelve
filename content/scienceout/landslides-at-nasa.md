## Landslides @ NASA

View the project [**here**](https://gpm.nasa.gov/landslides/index.html).

### Overview

NASA scientists are building an open global inventory of landslides and we need your help! Knowing where and when landslides occur can help communities worldwide prepare for these disasters. Become a citizen scientist and you can help inform decisions that could save lives and property today.

Landslides cause billions of dollars in infrastructural damage and thousands of deaths every year worldwide. Data on past landslide events guides future disaster prevention, but to date we do not have a global picture of exactly when and where landslides occur. NASA is building the biggest open global landslide inventory to address this problem, and the only way we can do this is with the help of citizen scientists like you!

The **Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository**, or COOLR, is an open platform where scientists and citizen scientists can share landslide reports. See all landslide data from COOLR with other scientific data using the [Landslide Viewer](https://landslides.nasa.gov/viewer) application. Want to contribute? Add to COOLR using our citizen science application, [Landslide Reporter](https://landslides.nasa.gov/reporter).
