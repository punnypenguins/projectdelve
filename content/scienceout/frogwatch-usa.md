## FrogWatch USA

View the project [**here**](https://frogwatch.next.fieldscope.org/).

### Overview

[FrogWatch USAâ„¢](https://frogwatch.next.fieldscope.org/) is a citizen science program of the [Association of Zoos and Aquariums](http://www.aza.org/) that invites individuals and families to learn about the wetlands in their communities and help conserve amphibians by reporting data on the calls of local frogs and toads.

Volunteers are trained to collect information about the calls from frogs and toads during the monitoring season of February through August.

Get trained to listen to frogs and toad calls in your area to help us monitor local frog populations, rare and invasive species, and shifts in species diversity, range, and seasonal timing. (ONLINE TRAINING AVAILABLE IF THERE'S NO IN-PERSON AVAILABLE IN YOUR AREA!)
