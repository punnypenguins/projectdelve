## Pollinators and Climate

View the project [**here**](https://budburst.org/pollinators-and-climate).

### Overview

Help us understand how plant-pollinator interactions are responding to a changing climate.

Changes in pollination has significant impacts on how we humans live our lives and interact with our environment on a daily basis. Pollinator and pollinator health changes the success of fruiting for plants and our food supply and therefore our health. We know that phenological events can vary from year to year, but how are pollinators affected by these variations. Submit data to help us understand how insect emergence, pollen availability, and climate conditions impacts plant-pollinator interaction.

**Research Question:** How is climate change affecting plant-pollinator interactions?

**Challenges:**
- [First Flowers](https://budburst.org/first-flowers) - Spring is important as pollinators emerge! Help us track when they appear.
- [Summer Pollination](https://budburst.org/summer-pollination) - Help us track what pollinators are doing during the hottest time of the year.
- [Fall Flowers](https://budburst.org/fall-flowers) - Help us track pollinator activity this fall as they get ready to hibernate.
