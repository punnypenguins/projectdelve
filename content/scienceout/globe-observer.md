## GLOBE Observer

View the project [**here**](https://observer.globe.gov/do-globe-observer).

### Overview

When you download the [GLOBE Observer app](https://observer.globe.gov/get-the-app), you join the community of The GLOBE Program - citizen scientists, students, and teachers in 120+ countries around the world contributing to Earth system science research.

Your observations:
- Help monitor the conditions of clouds, water (especially as a habitat for mosquitoes), plants (trees and other land cover), and see change over time.
- Can be used to help interpret NASA and other satellite data.
- Are available for anyone to view and explore, including fellow citizen scientists and professional and student researchers

Within the app, GLOBE Observer includes:
- GLOBE Observer [Clouds](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nasaglobe/nasa-globe-cloud-gaze?utm_source=N...)
- GLOBE Observer Mosquito Habitat Mapper
- GLOBE Observer Land Cover
- GLOBE Observer Trees
