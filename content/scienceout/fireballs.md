## Fireballs in the Sky

View the project [**here**](http://fireballsinthesky.com.au/).

### Overview

Fireballs in the Sky is an innovative citizen science program that connects the public with the research of the [Desert Fireball Network](https://dfn.gfo.rocks/).

Meteorites have the potential to show us how the Solar System formed and evolved, coming from the very first bodies to be created. They act as a snapshot in time, holding the minerals that came from their parent bodies and are unchanged as they hurtle towards Earth. Studying a meteorite’s composition and tracing its orbit can therefore tell us about what type of body in the Solar System it came from and give us information about the composition of the early solar system that we otherwise wouldn’t be able to discover.

Sending spacecraft on asteroid sample return missions to collect space rocks can cost billions of dollars and take many years. The DFN complements these endeavors using cameras to track where meteorites will land to get ‘free samples’ from a number of different asteroids that come with a way to calculate their orbit. By combining the mineral data with the orbital data we can then create a geological map of the solar system.

Fireballs in the Sky invites everyone to learn about the science behind meteorites and get involved with the project. By downloading the Fireballs in the Sky app, you can report a sighting of a fireball to help our researchers collect data, view sightings by other users, and see information about upcoming meteor showers. You can also keep up to date with our research on this website, Facebook and Twitter.
