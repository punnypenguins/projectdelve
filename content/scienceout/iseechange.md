## ISeeChange

View the project [**here**](https://www.iseechange.org/).

### Overview

Our climate is changing—and so are we.

Share your experiences and collect data to investigate our environment and help our communities change.

ISeeChange was built because people all over the world--in rural areas and dense urban centers alike--are already seeing their daily lives affected by climate change. And as a result, they’re changing too.

At ISeeChange, we’re collaborating with climatologists, social scientists, urban planners, engineers, and health professionals to better understand natural and human changes regionally and globally. But we need your local stories and measurements to guide us!

What you see changing in your backyard, neighborhood, and city is important to our understanding of how climate change and weather affect our communities. Your observations and block-by-block insights can help cities, engineers and local organizations advocate for and create solutions to climate challenges. If you or your community has a question or hypothesis about how climate is changing your area, you can also use your ISeeChange account to collect data and answer those questions.
