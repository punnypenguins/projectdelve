## iNaturalist

View the project [**here**](https://www.inaturalist.org/).

### Overview

One of the world’s most popular nature apps, [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) helps you identify the plants and animals around you. Get connected with a community of over a million scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! What’s more, by recording and sharing your observations, you’ll create research quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. iNaturalist is a joint initiative by the [California Academy of Sciences](https://www.calacademy.org/) and the [National Geographic Society](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/).

Every observation can contribute to biodiversity science, from the rarest butterfly to the most common backyard weed. We share your findings with scientific data repositories like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to help scientists find and use your data. All you have to do is observe.
