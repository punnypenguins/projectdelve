## Target NEOs! 

View the project [**here**](https://www.astroleague.org/node/4017).

### Overview

**Target NEOs!*** is an exciting opportunity for amateur astronomers to participate in a long-term citizen science project that will contribute to basic scientific understanding of near-Earth objects (NEOs). Observers collect data about asteroids on a selected list and submit images and corresponding reports. These observations support spacecraft missions in progress and aid future mission designers and scientists. Citizen scientists’ astrometry and photometry data will enable scientists to test theoretical models about these objects to refine orbits and taxonomy. The observations, which are personally gratifying for the observer, represent important, real contributions to asteroid exploration. Some of the NEOs in this program are observable by 8-inch telescopes or larger equipped with CCD cameras.

A larger telescope will allow more objects to be observed. Remote observing is welcomed, too.

Many advanced amateur astronomers are highly skilled, possess large aperture telescopes equipped with research quality instrumentation, and are eager to engage in research-oriented activities. Your observations can complement professional observations by providing greater geographic coverage and creating larger data sets through more frequent observing.

Target NEOs! is natural follow-on project for observers who have completed the League’s [Regular and Gold Asteroid Certificates](https://www.astroleague.org/observing.html) and, yet, can be attempted by observers who have not completed these programs. We encourage observers to refer the Astronomical League’s Asteroid Observing Guide and the links below for tips on how to observe asteroids.

> *Target NEOs! or “NEO ALOP” is the companion program that carries on the legacy of the OSIRIS-REx Target Asteroids! citizen science program.
