## Did You Feel It?

View the project [**here**](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/dyfi/).

### Overview

Did You Feel It? (DYFI) collects information from people who felt an earthquake and creates maps that show what people experienced and the extent of damage.

Find the earthquake you felt, and then tell us about it. Not in the list? [Report an unknown event](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/tellus).

The Did You Feel It? (DYFI) system was developed to tap the abundant information available about earthquakes from the people who experience them. By taking advantage of the vast number of Internet users, we can get a more complete description of what people experienced, the effects of an earthquake, and the extent of damage. And best of all, with your help we can do so almost instantly.

By contributing your experience of the earthquake, either immediately afterward, or whenever it is possible for you to do so, you make a contribution to the scientific body of information about each earthquake. You also ensure that your area has been represented in the compilation of the maps of shaking. This is a two-way street: not only will you add valuable information on the extent of ground shaking and damage, but in the process we hope you will learn more about how other communities fared and gain a greater understanding of the effects of earthquakes.

DYFI data are now being used in a number of scientific applications. For example:

- Providing intensity data and for USGS ShakeMap
- Comparing the results of the National Seismic Hazard Maps with DYFI responses (Mak and Schorlemmer, 2015)
- Comparing intensity with the distribution of red and yellow tags for the Napa M6.0 earthquake (Boatwright et al., 2015)
- Analyzing the differences in shaking for natural and injection-induced events (Hough, 2014)
- Assessing the sampling bias of historic felt records (Hough, 2013)
- Estimating the felt areas of moderate earthquakes (Boatwright and Phillips, 2012)
