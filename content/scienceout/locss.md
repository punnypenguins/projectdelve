## Lake Observations by Citizen Scientists & Satellites (LOCSS)

View the project [**here**](https://www.locss.org/get-involved).

### Overview

The Lake Observations by Citizen Scientists & Satellites project seeks to better understand how the quantity of water in lakes is changing.

Are lake volumes affected most by precipitation, water table height, evaporation or some other factors? Knowing the answer to this question will help us better understand how water moves in relation to these lakes and the surrounding land and what that may mean for lake users and these ecosystems.

We are working with a network of citizen scientists who are reporting lake height by reading simple lake gauges.

We combine these measurements with surface area measurements of the lake derived from satellite images. By knowing the changes in both lake height and lake surface area, researchers can understand how the volume of water in a given lake is changing over time.

We are currently monitoring lakes in Alberta, Bangladesh, France, India, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, and Washington.
