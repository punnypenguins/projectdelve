## Wild and Scenic Rivers

View the project [**here**](https://www.adventurescientists.org/rivers.html).

### Overview

**SELECTIVE PROJECT.** Strict requirements.

**This is a multi-year effort to sample National Wild and Scenic Rivers. The project spans from northern Alaska to southeast Florida, from small scenic creeks to wild raging rivers.**

The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System contributes 10% of drinking water throughout the United States. In addition, these rivers are essential for their cultural, recreational, and natural value. However, water quality on the vast majority of these rivers has not been adequately surveyed.  

Framed by the five­-year window between the 50th anniversary of the WSR Act and the federal Clean Water Act, the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service­ have partnered with [Adventure Scientists](https://www.adventurescientists.org/) to survey water quality on protected rivers across the country, providing needed data at an unprecedented scale.

**We need rafters, canoers, kayakers, hikers, and others to help us collect data on Wild and Scenic Rivers across the country.** To volunteer, you must commit to collecting data at three sampling locations (or the same site three different times). Data collection requirements vary based on river.

Our partners at the USFS, BLM, and NPS as well as 40 state agencies have requested these data to better understand the water quality status and conditions on these rivers. State water quality agencies will use the data to inform their management decisions to comply with the Clean Water Act and supplement existing data to prioritize future assessments.

We carefully train volunteers and provide equipment to collect in-stream data on water quality. In addition, volunteers will assess  habitat, survey invasive species, and collect grab samples at select sites.
