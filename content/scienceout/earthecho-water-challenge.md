View the project [**here**](https://www.monitorwater.org/).

### Overview

The EarthEcho Water Challenge (formerly World Water Monitoring Challenge) is an international program that runs annually from March 22 (the United Nations World Water Day) through December and equips anyone to protect the water resources we depend on every day. The EarthEcho Water Challenge builds public awareness and involvement in protecting water resources around the world by engaging citizens to conduct basic monitoring of their local waterbodies.

Protecting the quality of water in our local watersheds is a critical part of ensuring the overall health of the environment and our communities. Participating in the EarthEcho Water Challenge is a great way to be part of the solution to water issues worldwide.

[This project does require water test kits.](https://www.monitorwater.org/order-kits) There is an application for a donation of test kits, the option to purchase multiple kits, the option to purchase one single kit, and the option to get replacement parts or more advanced testing kits if you want.
