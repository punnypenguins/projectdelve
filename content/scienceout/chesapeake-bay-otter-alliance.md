## Chesapeake Bay Otter Alliance

View the project [**here**](https://serc.si.edu/citizen-science/projects/chesapeake-bay-otter-alliance).

### Overview

The Chesapeake Bay Otter Alliance is a group of researchers from across the Smithsonian and local universities, with a goal to study and educate the public about North American River Otters in the Chesapeake Bay. We need your help to figure out where these otters are in the Chesapeake Bay!

Very little to no research has been done regarding the numbers, health, and populations of otters in the Chesapeake Bay. We need your help in creating a map of sightings, tracking their behavior, and scat sightings.

Our specific objectives include:
1. mapping river otter presence and abundance in the Rhode, South, and West Rivers
2. conducting diet and parasite analyses
3. developing protocols for citizen science engagement
4. generating K-12 curriculum on river otter biology and ecology
