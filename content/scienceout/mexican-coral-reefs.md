## Mexican Coral Reefs

View the project [**here**](https://www.adventurescientists.org/mexico-reefs.html).

### Overview

**SELECTIVE PROJECT.** Strict requirements.

Mexico’s Pacific Coast is home to some of the world’s most biodiverse coral reefs, underwater communities that support sharks, turtles, and other marine life. They also support human lives by buffering the coastline from intense storms and providing livelihoods from fishing and tourism. Yet these reefs are imperiled by ocean acidification, more frequent and powerful storms due to climate change, and damage from human overuse.

Teams of volunteer divers will survey up to 40 coral reef sites multiple times a year for several years.

**​We're looking for experienced, conservation-minded divers with access to boats who can commit to at least three dives within a year along the Mexican Pacific coast in the Puerto Vallarta region.** Volunteers must have a minimum of 25 logged dives if a PADI certified open water diver,15 if PADI advanced open water diver, and 10 dives if they are a NAUI certified advanced open water diver.

Each volunteer diver will be required to commit to conducting a minimum of three site surveys. Survey sites are clustered, making access to three sites during a single multi-day visit manageable. Volunteers will be required to complete an online training and a 2-day in-person training in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The online training will cover the protocol basics and give an overview of expected species identification.

**The data we collect will help local authorities and NGOs improve current management practices, consider establishing new protected areas, and help make the reefs more resilient to climate change.**
