## cyanoScope

View the project [**here**](https://cyanos.org/cyanoscope/).

### Overview

cyanoScope uses modern technologies and a social approach to learn more about cyanobacteria and their distribution. By participating you will be helping scientists and water resource managers gain information on the occurrence of cyanobacteria in surface waters.

We will use submitted reports to map the spatial distribution and seasonal occurrence of cyanobacteria in lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.

Collect cyanobacteria:
1. collect cyanobacteria with a net tow,
2. prepare your microscope slides,
3. identify cyanobacteria found in your sample.

Then submit your images:
1. take pictures of cyanobacteria found in your sample,
2. upload the images and relevant info on iNaturalist.org.

And finally:
1. the iNaturalist community can help confirm the identity of cyanobacteria,
2. you can view and comment on images submitted by others,
3. everyone can explore patterns of the appearance of cyanobacteria.
