## Dragonfly Mercury Project

View the project [**here**](https://www.nps.gov/articles/dragonfly-mercury-project.htm).

### Overview

The Dragonfly Mercury Project engages citizen scientists such as students and teachers in the collection of juvenile dragonflies, also known as dragonfly larvae, from national parks for mercury analysis.

Experience the Dragonfly Mercury Project by watching [this short video](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/dmpvideo.htm). Then, grab some rubber boots and a sampling net and join park rangers as we search for juvenile dragonflies! Park rangers and enthusiastic volunteer citizen scientists collect many times the number of dragonflies from many more parks than would be possible for scientists alone. Since 2011, over 100 national parks and more than 4,500 citizen scientists have participated in this dynamic, nationwide project.

You can use the [Find a Park](https://www.nps.gov/findapark/index.htm) feature to see if a park near you is hosting sampling events.
