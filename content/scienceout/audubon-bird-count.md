## Audubon Christmas Bird Count

View the project [**here**](https://www.audubon.org/conservation/science/christmas-bird-count).

### Overview

The Christmas Bird Count occurs December 14 to January 5 every year.

Frank Chapman and 26 other conservationists initiated the Christmas Bird Count (CBC) as a way of promoting conservation by counting, rather than hunting, birds on Christmas Day of 1900. Some counts have been running every year since then and the CBC now happens in over 20 countries in the western hemisphere! Read about the history here. Now a long-standing program of the National Audubon Society, with over 120 years of community science involvement, it is an early-winter bird census, where thousands of volunteers across the U.S., Canada (where Audubon partners with Birds Canada), and many countries in the Western Hemisphere go out over a 24-hour period on one calendar day to count birds.

Each count takes place in an established 15-mile diameter circle, and is organized by a count compiler. Count volunteers follow specified routes through a designated 15-mile (24-km) diameter circle, counting every bird they see or hear all day. It's not just a species tallyâ€”all birds are counted all day, giving an indication of the total number of birds in the circle that day.

Birders of all skill sets are involved in the CBC. If you are a beginning birder, your compiler will pair you with an expert initially.

If your home is within the boundaries of a CBC circle, then you can stay at home and report the birds that visit your feeder on count day as long as you have made prior arrangement with the count compiler.
