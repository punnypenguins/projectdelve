## SKNOWLEDGE Collective

View the project [**here**](https://www.sknowledge.ca/).

### Overview

The Snow Knowledge Collective, or the SKNOWLEDGE Collective, is a school-based citizen science initiative sparking inquiry, collaboration, and discussion about snow in the environment and its significance for water resources in our communities. Learners are engaged through outdoor field-based activities, collecting valuable meteorological data from their school yard; because #TogetherWeKnowSnow.

This project uses low-cost equipment (a ruler!), field-based techniques (making a snowball!), interactive mapping tools, and learners keen observations to better understand seasonal snow variability and local impacts of climate change in their communities! Why snow? Because it is a challenging climate variable to monitor due to its significant influence by wind, sun, topography, freeze-thaw cycles, vegetation, and wet precipitation events (rain!) – just to name a few!

Through their participation, learners will build data literacy and launch their very own scientific investigations, all while spending time outside. Data contributed to the SKNOWLEDGE Collective will be used to explore how citizen science can validate satellite derived snow indices (like snow depth, extent, wetness), expand meteorological monitoring networks, and provide valuable insight to broader climate, meteorological, and hydrological processes.

​All data submissions are anonymous, and all data is publicly available.
