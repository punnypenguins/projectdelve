## Plants of Concern

View the project [**here**](https://plantsofconcern.org/).

### Overview

Interested in monitoring rare plants and joining our team? Fantastic!

**Plants of Concern is active in Northeastern and Southern Illinois. We invite you to join us in monitoring rare plants in these regions.**

We offer online training through a series of six video modules that you can view at any time. All modules together take approximately 45 minutes to watch. Short quizzes (less than 5 min each) separate each module. We encourage interested participants to take the online training in early spring and sign up for a group field event (foray) to find out what rare plant monitoring is all about.

Rare plants are at risk. In signing the confidentiality agreement you agree to not share locations of rare plant, lessening the risk of illegal collection or poaching.

Group monitoring events (forays) can serve as field training for participants who would like to get some experience before taking on an assignment of their own. These events are also a great way to meet other people who are interested in saving rare plants.

Plants of Concern staff will provide participants with an account. New account holders will receive an email with instructions on setting a password and filling out contact information.

Once you're ready to monitor, staff will assign you to a site and species. You'll have access to your assignment through your Plants of Concern account. You'll visit a subpopulation once a year, when the species is most visible. The Plants of Concern mobile app allows you to navigate to the subpop, collect GPS and other monitoring data, and submit your observations to the Plants of Concern database.
