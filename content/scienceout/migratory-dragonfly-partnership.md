## The Migratory Dragonfly Partnership

View the project [**here**](http://www.migratorydragonflypartnership.org/index/welcome).

### Overview

To better understand and conserve North America's dragonfly migration, dragonfly experts, nongovernmental programs, academic institutions, and federal agencies from the United States, Mexico, and Canada have formed the collaborative Migratory Dragonfly Partnership (MDP).

Regular monitoring and centralized reporting among participants across three nations will help us answer some of the many questions currently surrounding dragonfly migration and provide information needed to create cross-border conservation programs to protect and sustain the phenomenon. This site will allow you to submit dragonfly migration observations.

**Current projects:**

1. Dragonfly Pond Watch
Participants  visit  the  same  pond  or  wetland  regularly throughout the year and note the presence, emergence, and behaviors of any of the five main migratory dragon-fly species.

2. Migration Monitoring
Participants  monitor  the  timing,  duration,  and direction of travel of migrating dragonflies, and note any additional behaviors observed in a migratory flight such as feeding or mating. Photos or videos are strongly encouraged to aid in identification. When gathered across a wide geographic range and throughout a span of years, these  data  will  provide  answers  to  questions about  which  species  are  regular  migrants;  the frequency and timing of migration in different species; sources, routes, and destinations of migrants; and patterns of reproduction, emergence, and  movement  among  migratory  dragonflies along their flight paths.
