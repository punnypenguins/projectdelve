## Community Snow Observations (CSO)

View the project [**here**](https://communitysnowobs.org/).

### Overview

CSO is a citizen science campaign to measure snow. Make your backcountry travels count! We need your help measuring snow depths in mountain places too vast for researchers to monitor.

Your observations help us predict snow conditions and improve safety for mountain travelers.

This project aims to improve our understanding of snow depth variability in mountainous regions. We need community-based observers, including backcountry professionals and recreationists, to help gather snow observations.
