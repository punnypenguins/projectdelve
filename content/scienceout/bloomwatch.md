## bloomWatch

View the project [**here**](https://cyanos.org/bloomwatch/).

### Overview

Do you notice that a lake suddenly turned the color of pea soup or a blue-green paint spill? Or do you see green clumps, flakes or filaments floating in a lake?

Blooms in fresh waterbodies are commonly due to cyanobacteria, which have the potential to produce toxins that affect humans, pets, and our ecosystems.

State and local officials canâ€™t be watching every lake at all times! By using the bloomWatch app on your smartphone, you can help us understand where and when these organisms may be causing issues.

Available for iOS and Android devices.
