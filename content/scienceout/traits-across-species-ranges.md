## Traits Across Species Ranges (TASpeR)

View the project [**here**](https://sites.bu.edu/tasper/).

### Overview

**T**raits **A**cross **Spe**cies’ **R**anges is a community science project focused on understanding how variation within plant species influences the size and movement of different pools of elements (e.g., carbon, nitrogen) on the surface of the Earth.

For 2021 we are currently focused on developing partnerships with community scientist groups and individuals to survey patterns of green vs. freshly fallen leaf nutrient concentrations (i.e., foliar nutrient resorption) of red maple (*Acer rubrum*), along with other nearby species, throughout red maple’s geographic distribution.

The citizen scientists we partner with will collect leaves from a single red maple tree, at peak growing season in August and again when leaves fall from the tree. In order to do this you have to be able to identify a red maple. We are currently putting together a guide on how to identify maple species. In particular, the guide will focus on differentiating red maple (Acer rubrum) from other maples such as silver maple (Acer saccharinum) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) – stay tuned!

In addition to providing the leaf samples, citizen scientists will also fill out a form to provide more information about the particular tree and ecosystem from which they sampled.
