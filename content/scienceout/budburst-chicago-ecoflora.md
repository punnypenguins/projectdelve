## PROJECT NAME

View the project [**here**](https://budburst.org/chicago-ecoflora).

### Overview

Help us track native and non-native plant species in Chicagoland.

Now more than ever we need to understand urban flora-both native and invasive species. The Chicago EcoFlora project is collecting observations of plants in Cook County, Illinois to learn more about local plant life and contribute to conservation planning. With your help, we will collect data on important native species and troublesome new invaders that call our city home. This project will inform Chicago Park District, the Forest Preserves of Cook County, and other land managers about native plants that need protection and invasive species that need control. Each month we post an EcoQuest, where we ask you to find and report particular species of interest.

You can take observations anywhere in Cook County, Illinois! If you are visiting select Chicago Parks or Forest Preserves of Cook County, you can receive an activity backpack with our EcoQuests, plant ID guides, datasheets, and more.
