## Citizen Science Soil Collection Program

View the project [**here**](https://whatsinyourbackyard.org/).

### Overview

The key to the next life-saving biomedical discovery might be living right below your feet. Dozens of fungi can occupy a single handful of soil and many of them are adept at making new compounds called natural products. These remarkable molecules hold tremendous promise for treating human diseases.

It only takes a few minutes to help by collecting a scoop of soil.

Established in 2010 as the first operation of its kind, the Citizen Science Soil Collection Program is asking you for your dirt. You can play a vital role in this important research.

Over the last century, researchers have obtained many important drugs from fungi including antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering medicines, and immunosuppressants. Astonishingly, all of these drugs were found based on efforts that explored roughly just 5% of the Earth’s fungal species. With so much potential to provide new medicines, our research group is working to test as many new fungi as possible for drug-like molecules. But we cannot do this job on our own – we need your help. Whether you live in a big city, a rural town, or the pristine wilderness, the soil in your yard is teeming with new and untested fungi. To start your journey toward becoming a citizen scientist, all we ask is for you to send us a small scoop of soil from your yard. This simple, yet important act will help our team to continue the process of exploring fungi as a source of new medicines.

We want you to continue the journey with us as we test samples and add them to our open-access data sharing website. Using the online ShareOK system, you can view photos of fungi from your sample, find out about the types of fungi that were discovered, and compare your results to those from people living in your region and across the nation. We also offer a variety of online educational materials that enable citizen scientists both young and old to continue the quest by digging deeper into the world of fungi and drug discovery.
