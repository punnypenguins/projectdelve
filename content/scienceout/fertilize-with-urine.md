## Fertilize with Urine

View the project [**here**](http://richearthinstitute.org/get-involved/fertilize-with-urine/).

### Overview

Since founding the Institute, we have heard countless stories from people using urine in home gardens, often with spectacular results. Though they may not realize it, they are continuing an ancient practice, as there is a long history of recycling of human urine as fertilizer. In recent years, home urine reuse has taken new relevance as a way to promote water quality and protect lakes and rivers from nutrient pollution.

Do you already fertilize your garden with urine? [We want to hear about it!](tinyurl.com/UrineMyGardenSurvey)

This community science survey will contribute to a growing body of knowledge about where, how, and why people fertilize with urine in their home gardens around the world. While we know urine is used by many, we have little detailed information about specific practices. Your experiences will help us grow our understanding of how urine works for different crops, in varying conditions and will inform our educational efforts. Please take a few minutes (10-20) to complete this survey and share your experiences with the art, science, and practice of fertilizing with urine.
