## Air Quality Citizen Science

View the project [**here**](https://aqcitizenscience.rti.org/).

### Overview

Are you interested in helping in this NASA-funded science project? Do you have interest in understanding more about the air quality in your neighborhood? Would you like to measure air quality near your home or place of work? Have you been intrigued by the type of data that NASA collects from their satellites? Then this is the perfect opportunity for you to get involved! Participating in this project will teach you how to interact with and analyze satellite and ground PM data and introduce you to a community of citizen scientists also engaged in this area.

Current NASA Earth Science aerosol products generally report aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is a column measure of aerosol. While AOD is often correlated with surface PM2.5 (fine PM having aerodynamic diameter of ≤ 2.5 µm), it is not a surface measure. Current surface PM2.5 networks are too spatially sparse to evaluate whether AOD gradients can relate to surface PM2.5 gradients. Therefore, our over-arching objective is to add value to NASA's suite of satellite-based observations that relate to surface air quality (AQ). Specifically, we are deploying a network of good-quality, yet "low-cost" sensors with citizen scientists. By hosting these sensors, citizen scientists can monitor their local PM2.5 loading as well as learn from the project team on how to assess local, regional, and global AQ.

This sensor network will generate spatially and temporally resolved AQ data that complement satellite observations. It will both validate and help interpret the current state of satellite-informed PM2.5 estimates. By partnering with citizen scientists, such efforts can be cost-effective and sustainable, while also enhancing NASA’s mission to support the next generation of scientists.

Anyone not in the regions of focus (Los Angeles, CA, Raleigh, NC, and Delhi, India) may participate in the project, too! Please fill out the Raleigh/Delhi questionnaire and the project team will contact you with upcoming workshops shared over video conference.
