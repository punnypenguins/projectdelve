## Celebrate Urban Birds Project

View the project [**here**](https://celebrateurbanbirds.org/cub/instructions).

### Overview

From the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](http://birds.cornell.edu/).

1. Learn to identify your regional birds.
2. Choose your birdwatching area.
3. Watch birds for 10 minutes a day for 3 days.
4. Report your results!

 Our vision is to embrace community-led scientific research and programming and promote inclusive, accessible, and equitable birdwatching for all. We believe that birds have the power to connect us â€” as long as we intentionally value and center the power of equitable co-creation in birdwatching, monitoring, and conservation projects, and focus on culture through local leadership, creativity, and knowledge.
