## Aurorasaurus

View the project [**here**](https://www.aurorasaurus.org/).

### Overview

Aurorasaurus is the first and only citizen science initiative that tracks auroras around the world via reports on our website and social media. All aurora-related tweets and reports are placed on the Aurorasaurus.org map. We then ask people to log in and verify the tweets or reports. Each verified report serves as a valuable data point for scientists to analyze and incorporate into space weather models.

Report aurora sightings on the website's home page [**here**](https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/79750/), or help verify potential aurora-spotting Tweets [**here**](https://aurorasaurus.org/verify-tweets)!

Over the last [decade](http://blog.aurorasaurus.org/?p=724), citizen scientists have helped us establish that:
- Space weather can be [detected in real time on social media](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL063709)
- Auroras can be [visible further south](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015SW001320) than modeling predicts
- Building citizen scientist reports into space weather alerts makes them [more accurate](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016EA000167)
Report aurora sightings on the website's home page [**here**](https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/79750/)!
- [Crowdsourced verification]() of citizen science observations works

In addition, our project collaborated with citizen scientists from the Alberta Aurora Chasers and other scientists on the discovery, analysis, and publication of the subauroral phenomenon STEVE.
