## Timber Tracking

View the project [**here**](https://www.adventurescientists.org/timber.html).

### Overview

**SELECTIVE PROJECT.** Strict requirements.

**Do you care about healthy forests? You can apply to join this project if you are a hiker, a birder, a biker, a forager, or a tree lover to explore the hardwood forests of the eastern and central United States in search of black walnut trees!.**

One of the most valuable hardwood species in the United States, black walnut trees are threatened by timber poaching across the 30+ states in their range. Timber prices are skyrocketing and a black walnut tree can be worth $50,000, making them especially attractive to thieves. This impressive species is a critical part of the canopy as well as a valuable food source for fox squirrels and other creatures. It's well worth protecting.

The species has been cloned and planted across the world, so your backcountry skills are especially needed to take samples from wild trees on public lands. Those samples will become the basis of chemical and DNA databases that law enforcement can use to prosecute timber thieves.

We're collecting thousands of leaf, seed, and wood samples to create databases of the chemical and genetic signatures of tree species throughout their ranges. This information will power new tools to reveal the origin of any sample of timber––taking away illegal loggers' ability to sneak poached trees into the world's wood supply.

**Sample collection for eastern black walnut will kick off in July 2021.** Data collection will take place on public lands (forests, refuges, reserves) throughout the Eastern black walnut range in the US. These trees grow from western Connecticut and Massachusetts to the coast of North Carolina, from Georgia and west until eastern Texas, north through Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska, and across the southern regions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York.

Once collected, our samples will undergo two forms of processing: Mass Spectrometry-Data Analysis in Real Time (MS-DART or DART) and genetic analysis.

**We are seeking adventurous individuals who will follow detailed protocols, communicate regularly with the Adventure Scientists team, and follow through on their commitments in a timely matter.**
