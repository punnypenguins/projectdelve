2. Improving accessibility for people that usually experience barriers to access

## Types of inequality Project Delve impacts
- Educational inequality
- Participation inequality
- Health inequality
- Income inequality
- Social and geographic barriers to access
- Technological barriers to access
- Disability access issues

## ‚≠ê Disclaimer: On validity of information
We're in an era where there is a very strong tendency towards rejecting expertise and information.

As a scientist, writer, and frequent victim of gaslighting in my own personal life, there's nothing I value more in discussions than transparency and provable facts. So, I'm [**sharing all the sources**](https://projectdelve.com/this-site-matters/sources) I've learned from or referenced, and I encourage you to _**not**_ trust a single thing I say.

Go look at data yourself and see if the math checks out. Go read first-hand reporting. Go find sources that you can verify using critical thinking. My sources, much like Wikipedia, can be your starting springboard, but you need to dig around and verify until you confidently understand facts *yourself.*

**Do not inherently trust me. I am an unknown stranger on the internet.** You have *no* guarantee I'm not lying to you or twisting information/perceptions. Just because I sound confident, write well, or sound nice, it doesn't mean I'm *right*.

If you have any doubts about what I say, *please go find verifiable information yourself.* You need to trust your instincts and get confident you can tell fact from falsehood. Follow your doubts. Truth doesn't worry about being looked into. If information you're told is valid, you'll be able to confirm that. And if it *isn't?* Then good on you for finding out the truth!
