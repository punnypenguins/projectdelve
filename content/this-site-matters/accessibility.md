# What is accessibility?

While most of what you find in a quick Google search for "accessibility" is about website and application accessibility for disabled users, accessibility is a lot broader than that.

Accessibility for the disabled community covers everythingâ€”physical access, internet sites, technology, education, jobs, etc., which is already much bigger than simply accessible website design and accessibility settings on phones and other technology.

Accessibility for *everyone* encompasses all of those things for *all* populations within our society. What does this mean in reality, though? What are some examples?
