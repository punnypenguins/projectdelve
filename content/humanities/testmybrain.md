## TestMyBrain

View the project [**here**](https://testmybrain.org/index.php).

### Overview

TestMyBrain is a not-for-profit initiative dedicated to collaborating with citizen scientists throughout the world by providing measurement tools that allow people to engage in science and learn about themselves.

At TestMyBrain, we have the same goal that you do - to understand more about your brain. All of our experiments are designed to provide personalized feedback that is specific to you and will help you learn more about your own mind and brain.

What we learn from your participation helps us understand more about how the brain works, how we change as we get older, and the mental and physical disorders that affect brain health.
