### Overview

Here at MIT's Early Childhood Cognition Lab, we're trying a new approach in developmental psychology: bringing the experiments to you. Your family can contribute to research about how children learn by doing fun activities together, right in your web browser.

If you have a child and would like to participate, create an account and take a look at what we have available for your child's age range. You'll need a working webcam to participate.

When you select a study, you'll be asked to read a consent form and record yourself stating that you and your child agree to participate. Then we'll guide you through what will happen during the study. Depending on your child's age, your child may answer questions directly or we may be looking for indirect signs of what she thinks is going on--like how long she looks at a surprising outcome.

Some portions of the study will be automatically recorded using your webcam and sent securely to the Lookit platform. Trained researchers will watch the video and record your child's responses--for instance, which way he pointed, or how long she looked at each image. We'll put these together with responses from lots of other children to learn more about how kids think!
