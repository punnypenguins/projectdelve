## FaceResearch.org

View the project [**here**](http://www.faceresearch.org/).

### Overview

FaceResearch.org allows you to participate in short online psychology experiments, most of which are about how we perceive faces and voices. All experiments can be found [listed here](http://www.faceresearch.org/exp/), and you can play with face demos [here](http://www.faceresearch.org/demos/).

In addition to participating in face perception experiments, you can also complete lifestyle and personality questionnaires about characteristics that may be associated with face and voice perception and see how you compare to others.

FaceResearch.org is run by Lisa DeBruine and Ben Jones, who also run the Face Research Lab at the University of Glasgow Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology. We're experimental psychologists working at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. We're interested in how people read faces and the ways in which this relates to experiences they have during their life.
