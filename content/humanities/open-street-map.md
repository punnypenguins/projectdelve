## OpenStreetMap

View the project [**here**](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

### Overview

OpenStreetMap is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, caf√©s, railway stations, and much more, all over the world.

OpenStreetMap emphasizes local knowledge. Contributors use aerial imagery, GPS devices, and low-tech field maps to verify that OSM is accurate and up to date.

OpenStreetMap's community is diverse, passionate, and growing every day. Our contributors include enthusiast mappers, GIS professionals, engineers running the OSM servers, humanitarians mapping disaster-affected areas, and many more.
