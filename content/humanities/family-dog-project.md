## Family Dog Project

View the project [**here**](https://familydogproject.elte.hu/participate-in-our-research/).

### Overview

Family Dog Project was founded in 1994 to study the behavioral and cognitive aspects of the dog-human relationship. It is currently the largest dog research group in the world, has over 100 publications in peer-reviewed journals, with several papers in the highest ranking scientific journals such as Science, Current Biology and Trends in Cognitive Sciences.

We hypothesised that dogs have evolved to survive in the anthropogenic environment, and our investigations aim at revealing the contribution of humans and dogs to this long-standing partnership. Thus we are not solely interested in the mental abilities of dogs but in all aspects of human and dog behaviour that have strengthened this bond, and may even expand it further. Surprisingly, in our experience this research does not only reveal important insights on dogs but also on us, people.
