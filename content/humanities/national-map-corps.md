## The National Map Corps

View the project [**here**](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/tnm-corps).

### Overview

By updating and verifying structures data, volunteers are making significant contributions to USGS National Structures Database, The National Map, and ultimately U.S. Topo Maps!

TNMCorps is an online crowdsourcing mapping project with volunteers successfully editing structures in all 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Anyone with an interest in contributing can volunteer. It is easy to [sign up and get started](https://edits.nationalmap.gov/tnmcorps/#)! All you need is access to the internet, an email address, and a willingness to learn. “How to” documentation including a comprehensive [User Guide](https://navigator.er.usgs.gov/help/vgistructures_userguide.html) and a [Quick Start Guide](https://navigator.er.usgs.gov/help/WebHelp/index.html#Quick_Start_Guide.htm) will have you up and editing quickly.

Volunteers earn virtual badges for participating and are recognized for their contributions (with permission) via USGS and National Map social media.
