### Overview

Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Linguistic Data Consortium and Department of Computer and Information Science, the University of Essex, Queen Mary University of London, Sorbonne Université, Loria (the Lorraine Laboratory of Research in Computing and its Applications), Inria (the French National Institute for Computer Science and Applied Mathematics), and the Université de Montpellier have teamed up to bring together a group of online games that contribute to research in language science and technology. Lovers of language, grammar, and literature can test their knowledge, earn high scores, and compete against other players in a variety of challenging games. Simply by playing language games online you can help create linguistic data used by researchers to improve language technologies.
