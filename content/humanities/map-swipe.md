## Map Swipe

View the project [**here**](https://mapswipe.org/).

### Overview

MapSwipe is an open-source mobile app that is making mapping around the world more coordinated and efficient. We believe that anyone, anywhere should be able to contribute to the Missing Maps project. We aim to proactively map places in the world that are most vulnerable to crisis before a crisis happens. From the comfort of a mobile phone, MapSwipe allows any individual to support humanitarian response in three simple steps:

1. Complete tasks by swiping through satellite imagery of areas that need mapping.
2. The data is used by the Missing Maps project to map vulnerable areas in more detail.
3. The maps help organisations coordinate humanitarian efforts and save lives.

Within MapSwipe, users will soon be able to select to contribute towards three different project types. Each set of imagery is viewed by at least three different individuals to create a mechanism for internal validation of results. Learn more about each project type below and download the app to go through a complete tutorial before you begin swiping.
