## Fidget Widgets

View the project [**here**](http://game.engineering.nyu.edu/fidget-widgets/).

### Overview

Do you doodle, fidget, or fiddle with things on your desk while you work?  A surprisingly large number of people do. Perhaps these behaviors are not nearly as trivial as they might seem.

You can help with this research! [Tell us](https://fidgetwidgets.tumblr.com/) about the things you play with while you work.

Ever notice how people play with some kind of a thing — pen, paperclip, stress ball, magnets, marker, etc. — while lost in thought as they work? Maybe you do it too. There’s a powerful link between the hand and the brain. Research shows that our feelings, thoughts, and body are very much interconnected.

Our Fidget Widgets project is exploring this behavior and the opportunity for small, tangible, digital interactions to tap into what happens while people fiddle with objects as they work.
