## Fix It+ Project: American Archive of Public Broadcasting

View the project [**here**](http://fixitplus.americanarchive.org/).

### Overview

Help the American Archive of Public Broadcasting fix computer-generated transcripts from thousands of historic public broadcasting programs from across the country.

We need you to help ensure that public media remains accessibleâ€”not just today's broadcasts, but the archive all the way back to the beginning.

FIX IT+ users can correct transcripts for any of the historic programs available in the AAPB's Online Reading Room. Find a program of interest in the archive and help make the program accessible and discoverable by following along the computer-generated transcript, making corrections along the way.
