## DRAW - Data Rescue: Archives and Weather

View the project [**here**](https://citsci.geog.mcgill.ca/).

### Overview

Help us uncover the story of Montreal's evolving climate captured in the McGill Observatory's historical weather logs. Your transcriptions will help scientists and historians gain a better understanding of our environment and its impact on our city and its people.

DRAW, which stands for 'Data Rescue: Archival and Weather', allows volunteers to participate in the transcription of historical weather logs captured at the McGill weather observatory since 1863. Our about pages can tell you more about the DRAW project, the history behind it, and meteorological observations.

Scientific records were meticulously and patiently kept throughout the long history of the McGill Observatory, which amounts to several tens of thousands of pages of weather logbooks, journals, letters, official reports and other historical documents.

Digitizing all the information contained in the logbooks would take upward of 45, 000 hours of work for a single person. This is why we need your help!

By transcribing the weather observations into our database, you are helping atmospheric scientists develop a better understanding of how climate has been changing over the last hundred and fifty years of record-keeping.
