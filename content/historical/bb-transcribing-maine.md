## Beyond Borders: Transcribing Historic Maine Land Documents

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mainehistory/beyond-borders-transcribing-historic-maine-land-documents).

### Overview

Help turn our collection of 17th-19th century handwritten documents relating to Maine's land history into text that may be more easily read, keyword searchable, and accessed by students, teachers, and historians.

Maine Historical Society received a grant in the summer of 2020 from the National Endowment for the Humanities to fully digitized three significant land collections covering 1625-1893. In addition to digitization, Maine Historical is making an effort to transcribe these collections for easier access to their historic content.
