## Addressing Health

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/dhlbrown/addressing-health).

### Overview

Why did the UK's Post Office employees in the nineteenth century retire from work? Some reached retirement age but many had to end their careers early because of ill health. Be a part of this Wellcome-funded project to find out what Post Office workers' lives tell us about the history of health and wellbeing in the Victorian period. Transcribe the records of their career histories from images of documents held at the Postal Museum, London.
