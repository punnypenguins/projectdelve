## Voices Through Time: The Story of Care

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/jojo38/voices-through-time-the-story-of-care).

### Overview

Help us transcribe the records of Coram, the UK’s first children’s charity, to tell the story of care from where it began.

Our archive contains thousands of handwritten records, going back to the 1700s, which contain the stories of children who were cared for at the Foundling Hospital.

With your help transcribing these records, we can make them available online for the first time. We can find out more about the lives of children in care in the past, the institutions that cared for them, the history of Coram and the story of care in the UK.
