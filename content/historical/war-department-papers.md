## Papers of the War Department

View the project [**here**](https://wardepartmentpapers.org/s/home/page/home).

### Overview

The War Department office was established in 1790. It burned in 1800.

For decades historians believed that its files, and the window they provide into the early federal government, had been lost forever. This collection unites copies of the lost files in a digital archive that reconstitutes this invaluable historical resource. Our community of transcribers are working to create full text transcriptions of every possible document in the collection. Anyone can join the community and contribute to the project.
