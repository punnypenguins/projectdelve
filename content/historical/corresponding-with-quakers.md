## Corresponding with Quakers

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/rachaelsking/corresponding-with-quakers).

### Overview


The Quakers of Ballitore, Ireland, were a small group, but they have fascinating links to many major political issues of the period: abolitionism, women's rights, religious tensions, global migration, and the American and French Revolutions.

Corresponding with Quakers is an ongoing, collaborative research project investigating the Ballitore Collection held at UCSB Library’s Special Research Collections. The Ballitore Collection features more than 2,500 documents related to the Irish Quaker community of Ballitore, Ireland, including letters, journals, notebooks, and dream accounts. Originally assembled by the author Mary Leadbeater (1758-1826), this unique, understudied collection offers important insights into the intersection of gender, race, and religion in this period. The project, with funding from the UC-HBCU Initiative, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the American Council of Learned Societies, seeks to investigate and document the collection and in doing so to shed light on the transatlantic development of abolitionist thought, women’s writing, and communal religious practices. We are in the process of digitizing the collection for public access as well as computational analysis.
