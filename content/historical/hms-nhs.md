### Overview

Transcribing a hundred years of seafarer's medical data from the Dreadnought Seamen's Hospital in Greenwich, 1826-1930.

'HMS NHS: The Nautical Health Service', refers to the records of the Dreadnought Seamen’s Hospital at Greenwich. This was the main clinical site of the Seamen’s Hospital Society (now Seafarer’s Hospital Society), founded with the philanthropic mission of providing relief to sick and injured seafarers of all nations. Throughout the period 1821-1870 it was a floating hospital, based in three successive converted warships, the first named Grampus and later HMS Dreadnought, a veteran of the battle of Trafalgar. It then moved on land and until 1986 occupied the buildings which are now a student hub for the University of Greenwich.

The Admissions Registers we are transcribing include details such as a seafarer's name, age and place of birth, rank, employer and last vessel served on. Medical information includes dates of admission and discharge, medical condition, illness or injury and, at discharge, whether they were cured or not! Reflecting the international traffic of the port of London, the patients were seafarers from all over the globe. Casualties from local emergencies, among them women and children, were also admitted, as were naval personnel during wartime.

Traditionally used by family historians to trace individual maritime ancestors, the records also have significant research potential, including the history of medicine and diseases and the evolution of treatment of specific illnesses and injuries within the maritime workforce. They also show which illnesses were most prevalent in seaman returning from specific parts of the world, together with an almost unlimited number of case studies for examining how treatments changed in response to advances in medical knowledge, and the effect this had on recovery times. In addition, the records also offer additional perspectives on diverse subjects, such as the history of black and Asian communities within the maritime world. Viewed quantitatively, they show the variety and prevalence of disease, injuries and common ailments in the merchant navy for over a hundred years.
