### Overview

The [Stanford University Archives](https://library.stanford.edu/spc/university-archives/collections) is the official repository for records of Stanford University and serves as its institutional memory. The Archives collects, preserves, administers, and promotes access to materials in any format that document the history of Stanford, including its founders, administration, faculty, students, and alumni/ae. Our holdings include more than 30,000 linear feet of material and 20+ TB of electronic records within 2,200+ collections.
