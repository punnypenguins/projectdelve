## Notes from Nature - Capturing California's Flowers

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/md68135/notes-from-nature-capturing-californias-flowers).

### Overview

The California Phenology Network was originally an NSF-funded collaboration of 22 California herbaria that aimed to image 904,200 herbarium specimens by 2022. In July 2020, this network was expanded by a [partner-to-existing-network grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2001644) to include six additional institutions and over 148,000 more specimens, for a total of over one million specimens. We will also georeference and transcribe over 320,000 specimens, making their data publicly available on our [data portal](http://cch2.org/).

​​The digitization of herbarium specimens has advanced our ability to understand how organisms respond to changing conditions. However, when a digital record consists only of a taxon name, date, and location, we are limited in the types of research questions we can address. While label data such as these can be used to address changes in species distributions, high-resolution images of herbarium specimens add a rich source of additional information regarding plant health, reproductive condition, and morphology. High-resolution images allow researchers to access and make use of this information. Future digitization efforts will undoubtedly focus on capturing trait data from specimens, greatly expanding the use of specimens in research.
