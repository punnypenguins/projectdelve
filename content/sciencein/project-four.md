### Overview

Welcome to Planet Four, a citizen science project designed to help planetary scientists identify and measure features on the surface of Mars... the likes of which donâ€™t exist on Earth. All of the images on this site depict the south polar region, where dark seasonal fans and blotches appear during the Spring. By mapping these features in images from the HiRISE camera, the highest resolution camera ever sent to a planet, we can explore the Martian climate and how it changes over time.
