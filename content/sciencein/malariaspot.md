## MalariaSpot

View the project [**here**](https://malariaspot.org/en/).

### Overview

Malaria is one of the most serious threats to global health, with more than 200 million cases a year and which kills half a million people.The standard way to diagnose this disease is to count the number of parasites in blood samples using a microscope. This process may take up to 30 minutes. And there are not enough specialists in the world to diagnose all cases of malaria.

MalariaSpot is a project that wants to solve this problem with citizen participation. Together we can contribute to the diagnosis.

We turn the diagnostic process into a video game and combine the results of the players so that we obtain a reliable result. We did it MalariaSpot (2012), with Tuberculosis in TuberSpot (2014). And also MalariaSpot Bubbles to differentiate the different species of parasites. We know it works. MalariaSpot volunteers from 95 countries played more than 12,000 games that generated a database of 270,000 clicks. The fusion of the results of 22 inexperienced volunteers allows obtaining a parasite count as accurate as that of an expert microscopist.
