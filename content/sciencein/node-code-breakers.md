## Node Code Breakers: looking for patterns in lymph nodes

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/effeli/node-code-breakers-looking-for-patterns-in-lymph-nodes).

### Overview

We are running ‘Node Code Breakers: looking for patterns in lymph nodes’ to analyse images of lymph nodes from breast cancer patients. This project will generate data that will be used to help improve our AI model performance. We are trying to find the germinal centres, the light pink circles in lymph nodes. When the immune system spot something foreign, new immune cells were produced in germinal centres of lymph nodes. We are a computational group and work on artificial intelligence (AI) methods to capture these germinal centres in lymph nodes. In this project, we will compare our AI methods with your data.

In this project we need your help to study images of lymph nodes that were produced using whole slide image scanners (WSI scanner). A WSI scanner consists of an electron microscope and a computer. It scans the slides in a high magnification (max. 40x) which allows us to see every cell in this lymph node. An important step in studying these images is called “segmentation”: it describes the process in which someone or a computer program draws around the region of interest. We need your help to do this segmentation step!

With enough help from volunteers, we will improve further our AI model to perform the segmentation better. This has a huge potential to study breast cancer!
