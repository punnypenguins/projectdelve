## Project Herring

View the project [**here**](https://www.mysticherring.org/herring-project).

### Overview

Help us track river herring populations in the Mystic River watershed, and be part of an environmental success story. Watch a video (60 seconds max) and record what you see.

To provide even more data about the run size and behavior of herring, the Mystic River Watershed Association installed a “fish cam” at the upper Mystic Lakes and developed an online counting platform in 2017.

The camera is set up to record video clips whenever it detects  one or more fish passing through its field of view. These [video clips](https://www.mysticherring.org/video#/) are uploaded to this website in real time so that anyone from anywhere  can help count how many fish are migrating up the Mystic River.
