## Outbreaks Near Me

View the project [**here**](https://outbreaksnearme.org/).

### Overview

Created by epidemiologists and software developers at Harvard, Boston Children's Hospital and a group of volunteers from across the technology industry, Outbreaks Near Me uses crowdsourced data to visualize maps to help citizens and public health agencies identify current and potential hotspots for the recent pandemic coronavirus, COVID-19, and the annual influenza.

The website is the next generation of a tool called Flu Near You, created by Ending Pandemics and Boston Children's Hospital in 2012 and maintained by the Boston Children’s Hospital team.

Outbreaks Near You relies on voluntary participation from the general public, asking you to take a few seconds to report if you or your family members have been healthy or sick.

Our team analyzes thousands of reports and maps them to generate local and national views of COVID-like and influenza-like illness, providing public health officials and researchers with real-time, anonymous information that could help end the COVID-19 pandemic, lessen the impact of the seasonal flu, and prevent the next pandemic.

With your help, we can all see what’s happening and better still - you have the knowledge to protect yourself and your family against disease.
