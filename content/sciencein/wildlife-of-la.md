## Wildlife of Los Angeles

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/lawildlife/wildlife-of-los-angeles).

### Overview

In the United States greater than 80% of the human population occurs in cities, yet we know very little about the wildlife in these areas. Much work needs to be done to understand how increases in urbanized areas impact wildlife species and their ability to survive around us. Urbanization poses many threats to wildlife such as loss of habitat, fragmentation of habitat, roads and traffic, poisons and toxins, people, and our pets. This project is striving to collect information that can be used by city planners to help them make educated decisions about wildlife when planning future developments.

The Santa Monica Mountains Fund (SAMO Fund), a non-profit partner in conjunction with the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation area is conducting a study to identify a variety of wildlife at varying levels of urbanization: The photographs on this project were taken from camera traps placed at urban and natural park sites, golf courses, and small undeveloped patches within urban areas in and around Los Angeles.

Los Angeles is the second most populous city in the country, and has a diverse suite of species ranging from mountain lions, including the famous P22, to coyotes, gray foxes, bobcats, raccoons, skunks, opossums, etc... We know that there are a wide variety of species around Los Angeles, but little is known about the animals that live with the 3.9 million people in the city of LA.

The goal of this project using data collected through a partnership between SAMOFUND and the National Park Service is to work with partner agencies to leverage the information to improve conservation through out Los Angeles. Additionally, this project is part of a collaborative effort to collect data in urban areas through out the country to enable better management of wildlife living in and around urban areas.
