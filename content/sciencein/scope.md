## Stellar Classification Online Public Exploration (SCOPE)

View the project [**here**](http://scope.pari.edu/index.php).

### Overview

*Are all stars like the Sun?*

The answer to this basic question has driven the field of astronomy and astrophysics for nearly 100 years.

At SCOPE, you have the opportunity to explore this topic by observing stars, comparing their features to those of the Sun, and classifying them. Many of these stars have never been classified; _**you can be the very first person to measure the temperature of a star!**_ This is discovery in the purest sense of the word.

SCOPE is a Citizen Science project and is mining the data on photographic images of star spectra. The goal of SCOPE is the classification of hundreds of thousands of stars never before classified. The citizen scientist will help with this mountainous effort.
