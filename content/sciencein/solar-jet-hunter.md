## Solar Jet Hunter

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sophiemu/solar-jet-hunter).

### Overview

Join the hunt for solar jetsâ€”enigmatic bursts of energy from our own star, the Sun!

Studying solar jets, which are small and narrow ejections of solar material, may help us address some of the Sun's mysteries. For example, solar jets could be linked to energetic particles and perturbations in the solar wind. In this project, we focus on features that are found at various sizes and locations on the Sun, which can be observed clearly in extreme ultraviolet images.

The goal of this Zooniverse project is to build a database of solar jets. Building this database will provide a jumping-off point for researchers to study the physics of solar ejections. The database will allow researchers to find interesting cases, compare data across other types of solar activity databases, and conduct broad statistical studies of jet properties.
