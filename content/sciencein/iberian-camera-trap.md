## Iberian Camera Trap Project

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/aicensusuhu/iberian-camera-trap-project).

### Overview

Wildlife monitoring is often based on outdated protocols. However, advances in technology have paved the way for optimizing data collection and profusing cutting-edge analytical methods. Our cameras are placed in one of the most important protected areas in Europe, the Parque Nacional de Do√±ana (South Spain). Your classifications will serve to train an artificial intelligence algorithm to do the same with an exorbitant amount of images. Your help will make possible an automatic fauna census system capable of detecting changes in abundance and biodiversity more efficiently and in real-time than ever before.
