## Offal Wildlife Watching

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/embeller/offal-wildlife-watching).

### Overview

Who Eats your Guts? Help us better understand scavenging of deer gut piles provided by hunters across Minnesota. **IMPORTANT: _IMAGES SHOW ANIMALS FEEDING ON THE REMAINS OF DEER_**

The purpose of this research is to better understand what and when species use deer gut piles provided by hunters across Minnesota. Minnesota offers a unique opportunity to look at this across four different biomes and a major metropolitan area, different hunting methods (rifle, archery, and shotgun), and different scavenger assemblages. Hunters are uniquely positioned to record everything that comes in to feed on gut piles by setting a camera immediately after field dressing a deer.
