## COVID19 Tweet Annotation

View the project [**here**](https://covid-twitter.thecommons.science/).

### Overview

In this study, we aim to create a model of how tweets about self-reported COVID19 symptoms can help predict upcoming pandemic waves, and more generally the rise and fall of the disease. To that end, we crawled public tweets from the Paris region filtered by symptoms keywords, and plotted them in time (see the graph below).

However, this filtering is very crude, e.g people don't only tweet about symptoms when they are currently falling sick, but also about that one time a year ago when they fell sick, or when talking about the general news.

To filter out such false-positives we need your help! Which of these tweets are describing an acute symptom and which ones don't? Your contribution will make a direct impact!

_**NOTE:** The tweets in this study are in French._
