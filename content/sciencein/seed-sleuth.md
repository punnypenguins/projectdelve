## Seed Sleuth

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/lindsayburns28/seed-sleuth).

### Overview

Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) was the first plant to have its genome completely sequenced (circa 2000). Although technically a weed, this small plant has been transformed into an important model system for plant research.

This project aims to provide ABRC with new information about these seed lines by asking citizen scientists to quantify the number of mutant phenotypes and dead seeds in different seed samples. This citizen science project is valuable to the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center and the plant science community because it allows us to gather data for a large number of seed lines that we might not otherwise have the time to analyze.
