## The Heart Project

View the project [**here**](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/beats-per-life/).

### Overview

What is the secret to a long life? The heartbeat of some animals may hold a clue. We are consolidating reports of the heart rate and lifespan of as many vertebrate species as possible. Scanning through old books and papers, we have already found data on more than [150 species of mammals](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/beats-per-life/species-records/). **Now we need your help tracking down records for species of birds, reptiles and fish!**

Our goal is to integrate the data from various sources into a single database, where they can be more readily accessible. The data we need may be one [Google search](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Canis+rufus+%22heart+rate%22) away or buried deep within old work about unrelated topics.

Help us find new heart rate records! Once you locate a new record, submit it to our heart beat database.
