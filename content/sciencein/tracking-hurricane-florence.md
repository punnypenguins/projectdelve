## Tracking Hurricane Florence Flooding of Manure Lagoons (09/18 09/19)

View the project [**here**](https://cartosco.pe/kioskProject.html#/kioskStart/4Fpad06rhcql).

### Overview

Flooding from Hurricane Florence is causing manure lagoons from North Carolina's hog farms to over flow. This potentially "toxic soup" could spread bacterial disease, cause fish kills, algae blooms and harm human health. Help us monitor these structures by sorting aerial images captured by NOAA after the disaster.
