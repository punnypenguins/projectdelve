## New Particle Search at CERN

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/reinforce/new-particle-search-at-cern).

### Overview

You have the opportunity to contribute to the search for undiscovered particles, which are produced from the collisions of high-energy protons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the worldâ€™s most powerful particle accelerator.

While the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012, after about 40 years of intense experimental and theoretical research, and was the last missing component of our present model of particle physics, there are still many unanswered questions and even more theories that try to answer them. Through the visual study of proton-collision events at the LHC, you will learn data analysis skills, support the optimisation of the detectors, and help develop new knowledge in the structure of matter.

This project has been created by researchers of the ATLAS experiment collaboration, who are actively studying the Higgs boson and searching for yet-undiscovered particles. The data you will study, come from the collisions of proton beams in the LHC, and have been recorded by the ATLAS detector.
