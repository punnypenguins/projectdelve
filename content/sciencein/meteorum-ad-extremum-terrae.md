## Meteororum ad Extremum Terrae

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/acre-ar/meteororum-ad-extremum-terrae).

### Overview

Meteororum ad Extremum Terrae (MET - Meteorology of the End of the World) aims to recover weather and oceanic data record in Argentina since at least the beginning of the XIXth Century. The first currently known records date back to 1801. Other than the Oficina Meteorológica Argentina, later Servicio Meteorológico Nacional, many public and private organizations have registered weather data. Argentine Navy ships, lighthouses, railway stations, "estancias" are among many data sources. It is necessary to recover and digitize them. With these valuable records you help us recover for science, we can then study the evolution of climate in this part of the Southern Hemisphere, from the edge of Tropic of Capricorn into Antarctica. We can work with these records to assess climate processes and variability. We can improve international atmospheric models.

Tackling Climate Change requires that the past be understood to build a better future.
We invite you to volunteer for the task of recovering the past, for history and for research.
