## Planet Patrol

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/marckuchner/planet-patrol/).

### Overview

NASAâ€™s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission will take pictures of more than a million stars to search for planets orbiting them, called "transiting exoplanets". We expect this mission will see thousands of these transiting exoplanets when they pass in front of nearby stars and periodically block some of the starlight.

But sometimes when a star dims like that, it's not because of a planet. Variable stars, eclipsing binary stars, blended stars, glitches in the data, etc., can cause a similar effect. We need your help to spot these imposters!

At Planet Patrol, you'll help us check the data from the TESS mission, one image at a time, to make sure that objects we suspect are planets REALLY are planets.
