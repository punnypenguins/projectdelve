## Nest Quest Go: Sparrows

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/brbcornell/nest-quest-go-sparrows).

### Overview

Join the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Citizen-Science Project, NestWatch in understanding the historical nesting patterns of various sparrows, including Black-throated Sparrow, Vesper Sparrow, Savannah Sparrow, Chipping Sparrow, Song Sparrow, Field Sparrow, Lark Sparrow, Eastern Towhee and many more! Generally, for most types of sparrows, the female searches for a nest location and builds her nest with little to no help from the male, who often guards the nesting territory. However, Song Sparrows look for a nesting site together with their mate, often choosing somewhere low to the ground and near humans or water. Join us to learn more about sparrow-nesters!

These nest record cards are a subset of a larger collection of more than 300,000 nest records that NestWatch is working on digitizing and transcribing. Valuable scientific questions can be asked and answered regarding the nesting behavior of birds over time by examining historical records. We hope to bring new discoveries to light using these previously hidden datasets.
