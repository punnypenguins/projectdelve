## The Koster seafloor observatory

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/victorav/the-koster-seafloor-observatory).

### Overview

At the Koster seafloor observatory we want to know how climate change and human activities influence Sweden's marine ecosystems.

For the last 20 years, we have used Remotely Operated Vehicles and cameras to monitor the Kosterhavets National Park. A highly-diverse and unique marine reserve in the south of Sweden. Now, we need your help identifying the habitat, species, and presence of litter recorded in over 3,000 hours of underwater videos.

Your answers will allow us to filter out crucial information from the recordings and study how the fauna on the sea floor has changed in response to warmer waters, fishing activities, and changes in environmental protection.

Submerge yourself among large sponges, starfish, and cold-water corals to help us understand the health of the Koster's sea floor and how we can better protect it.
