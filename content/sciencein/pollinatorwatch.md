## PollinatorWatch

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tokehoye/pollinatorwatch).

### Overview

For the past three years time-lapse cameras set up at various locations across the Arctic have gathered millions of images of flowers. The goal is to monitor the periodic changes in plant and insect life and ultimately to train a computer to automatically locate and identify pollinators in the images. Now we need your help spotting the pollinators that visit the flowers!

Pollinators, such as bees and other insects, play important roles in many ecological processes such as pollination of crops, disease transmission and pest regulation. Currently, researchers are working hard to collect and identify insect samples in the hope of gaining a better understanding of how and why these species change in response to global change.

Automating some of this process frees up time for interpretation, consequently leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Your participation will help researchers gain a better understanding of the consequences of global change and help them spread this knowledge more widely.
