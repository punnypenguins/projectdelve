## Whooping Cranes!

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/whcr-cr/whooping-cranes).

### Overview

Help us look for large white birds (Whooping Cranes) in Northern Canada so we can monitor the population of this endangered species!

Whooping Cranes *(Grus americana)* are one of North Americaâ€™s rarest birds. The only remaining wild and self-sustaining population of Whooping Cranes breeds in northern Canada and winters on the Texas Gulf Coast. Canada has monitored the population by aerial surveys since the 1960s but the population is now growing quickly and expanding into new breeding areas. Aerial surveys may no longer be the most effective way to monitor Whooping Cranes, so the Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo, Canadian Wildlife Service, Parks Canada and International Crane Foundation are working collaboratively to investigate the use of high resolution satellite imagery to detect individual cranes and help monitor and manage this endangered species.
