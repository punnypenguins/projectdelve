## Wild Mont-Blanc

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/crea-mont-blanc/wild-mont-blanc).

### Overview

Help us explore the secret life of the Mont-Blanc massif! Our cameras track the distribution, behavior and seasonal rhythm of animals year after year.

Forty camera traps installed across Franceâ€™s Mont-Blanc massif are giving us a powerful new window into the dynamics of alpine wildlife species. The Research Center for Alpine Ecosystems (CREA Mont-Blanc) needs your help to identify all the different animals caught in hundreds of thousands of camera trap images.
