## UK Tides

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/psmsl/uk-tides).

### Overview

About 28% of the people live near the coast, and with global sea level rising, we need long records to be able to investigate how local tides and sea level are changing. One way this can be done is by recovering data from old documents. In this project, we are trying to convert data from old tide gauge ledgers from the North West of England into data usable by scientists.
