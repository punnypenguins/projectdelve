## Panoptic Astronomical Networked Observatories for a Public Transiting Exoplanets Survey (PANOPTES)

View the project [**here**](https://www.projectpanoptes.org/).

### Overview

[PANOPTES](https://www.projectpanoptes.org/) is an open source citizen science project designed to find [transiting exoplanets](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/transits/en/) with digital cameras. The goal of PANOPTES is to establish a global network of of robotic cameras run by amateur astronomers and schools (or anyone!) in order to monitor, as continuously as possible, a very large number of stars. For more general information about the project, including the science case and resources for interested individuals, see the [project overview](https://projectpanoptes.org/articles/).

POCS (PANOPTES Observatory Control System) is the main software driver for a PANOPTES unit, responsible for high-level control of the unit. For more information, see the full documentation at: https://pocs.readthedocs.io. [panoptes-utils](https://www.github.com/panoptes/panoptes-utils) is a related repository and POCS relies on most of the tools within panoptes-utils. See https://panoptes-pocs.readthedocs.io for more information.
