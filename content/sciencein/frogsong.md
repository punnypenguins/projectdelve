## FrogSong

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sladeaa/frogsong).

### Overview

With your help, researchers at James Cook University and Monash University aim to develop automated techniques to identify frog calls in very long audio recordings. This will allow us to understand the environmental drivers of frog chorusing, detect changes in frog communities through time, determine how species partition the acoustic space, and much more!

This project contains audio recordings collected by the Australian Acoustic Observatory at sites around Australia.
