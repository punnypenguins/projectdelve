## Notes from Nature - WeDigFLPlants

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/md68135/notes-from-nature-wedigflplants).

### Overview

[WeDigFLPlants](https://biospex.org/projects/wedigflplants) is a collaboration between professional research botanists, amateur naturalists, gardeners, educators, and citizen scientists to build the most complete picture possible of plant distribution and diversity in Florida over the past 200 years. The data for this historical baseline come from archived plant specimens curated by the world's 3,000 herbaria. Each of these specimens includes a label that answers the who, what, when, and where of the collecting event that produced it. Transcribing that label data into digital form and providing that data online at aggregators like [idigbio.org](http://idigbio.org/) and [gbif.org](http://gbif.org/) makes it available to scientists, educators, natural resource managers, and policymakers addressing societal challenges today and in the future. Today, there are >4,700 species of plants native or naturalized in Florida.

The plant specimen data created by WeDigFLPlants enable conservation biologists, natural resource managers, ecologists, and others to understand changes to the distribution and abundance of the flora of Florida, especially the components that are rare/endangered or introduced/invasive or of high economic value. The data are also critical to curators of herbaria who manage the specimens for use in perpetuity.
