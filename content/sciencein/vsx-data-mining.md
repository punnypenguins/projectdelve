## VSX Data Mining

View the project [**here**](https://www.aavso.org/vsx-data-mining).

### Overview

Social Distancing, Light pollution, bad weather... You can still work on meaningful projects from the comfort of your home. All you need is your computer, an internet connection, and patience. This is the first series of AAVSO data mining projects*, focusing on unveiling unknown properties of suspected variable stars. Enjoy!

The **American Association of Variable Star Observers** (AAVSO) is a non-profit worldwide scientific and educational organization of amateur and professional astronomers who are interested in stars that change in brightnessâ€”variable stars. We are an international non-profit organization of variable star observers whose mission is to enable anyone, anywhere, to participate in scientific discovery through variable star astronomy.

*Seven projects were available as of my last check on 02/11/2022.
