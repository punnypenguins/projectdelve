## Catalina Outer Solar System Survey

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/fulsdavid/catalina-outer-solar-system-survey).

### Overview

For over twenty years the Catalina Sky Survey has been collecting images of the sky night after night. Hidden deep in these images are exotic and primordial solar-system worlds yet to be discovered: Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs).

By looking at images of the same patch of sky over several months, the motion of distant TNOs can be detected. However, computers often make false detections, and this is where you come in! The detected motion need to be confirmed, and the human eye is supremely adapted to just this task. This project seeks volunteers to review animated images to make the final determination of whether an object is a real TNO or not. Are you ready to discover new distant, icy worlds?

The Catalina Sky Survey is funded by a grant from NASA and housed at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. It is one of the world's most prolific discoverers of Near Earth Asteroids.
