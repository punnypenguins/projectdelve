## Planet Hunters NGTS

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mschwamb/planet-hunters-ngts).

### Overview

The Next-Generation Transit Survey have been searching for transiting exoplanets around the brightest stars in the sky. We need your help sifting through the observations flagged by the computers to search for hidden worlds that might have been missed in the NGTS team's review. Most of the planets in the dataset have likely been found already, but you just might be the first to find a new exoplanet not known before!
