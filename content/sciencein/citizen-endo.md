## Citizen Endo

View the project [**here**](http://citizenendo.org/).

### Overview

In order to study a disease, we need to know what it looks like. When it comes to endometriosis, there are many different ways in which the disease can present itself in patients. There is a disconnect between how doctors think about the disease and what patients experience on a daily basis. Bridging this gap is critical to further research on endometriosis. Citizen Endo will use a series of studies to better understand the disease from the perspective of patients.

We are academic researchers who make tools (like mobile apps) to collect health data, explore it, and generate meaningful insights. We need patients' help to make this project a success. Success means engaging patients as active participants in our research so that we can gain a comprehensive description of the disease through patient-generated health data. We also seek to help patients make sense of the data they generate.

**Ongoing studies:
1. [Phendo](http://citizenendo.org/phendo/)
  - Phendo is a study to track, manage, and understand endometriosis. The app is available for iOS and Android.
2. [ENDL](http://citizenendo.org/endl/)
  - ENDL is a study to understand the relationship between the menstrual cycle, pain, and quality of life.  The app is available for iOS.
