## The Greater Bilby Sanctuary

### Overview

With climate change, drought conditions are becoming more frequent and severe in Australia. Greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis), like many other species, are sensitive to drought. To combat this conservation challenge, we need to think of creative solutions to support threatened species, such as the bilby, during drought.

In 2019, research collaborators at the University of New South Wales and the Taronga Conservation Society Australia released bilbies into a 110-ha semi-wild sanctuary at Taronga Western Plains Zoo, in Dubbo, NSW, for conservation breeding and release. This was also during a period of below average rainfall and drought conditions. Drought reduces the productivity of landscapes, and is also likely to limit the amount of feed freely available to the bilby. To support the establishing population we provided feed to the bilbies by burying feed in small 'pits' in front of camera traps. A grid of 19 evenly spaced camera traps monitored animal activity, including bilbies, across the fenced sanctuary.

With your help, researchers will use camera trap data to determine if, and how bilbies use feed sites, and, thus, how effective this management strategy is in helping support bilby populations through drought.
