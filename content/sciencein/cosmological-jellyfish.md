## Cosmological jellyfish

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/apillepich/cosmological-jellyfish).

### Overview

We are a group of researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Astronomy using simulations of the Universe to study the various ways in which galaxies in the Universe evolve, both through their own internal processes, and under the influence of their environment.

Galaxies in the Universe can come in many forms and shapes.

Some of them can show very asymmetric distributions, with long tails of material that depart from their main body made of stars and cosmic gas. This jellyfish-like shape, we think, is associated to certain physical processes that govern the interaction of galaxies with their surroundings.

To pin these processes down, we need to be able to distinguish between galaxies that appear "normal" and those that appear like "jellyfish". And we can do this both with galaxies observed in the real Universe as well as with those simulated at supercomputers.

Help us find galaxies that look like jellyfish!
