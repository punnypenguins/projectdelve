## OSDG Community Platform

View the project [**here**](https://osdg.ai/).

### Overview

OSDG is a partnership between [PPMI](https://www.ppmi.lt/), [UNDP SDG AI Lab](https://sdgailab.org/), and a community of researchers led by [Dr. Nuria Bautista Puig](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2404-0683). The project aspires to bring together the knowledge and expertise of people from around the world to better understand the nature of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The [Platform]()https://osdg.ai/community is an ambitious effort to bring together researchers, subject matter experts and SDG advocates from all around the globe to create a large and accurate collection of textual information on the SDGs. The goal of the labeling activities is to the relevance of each text to the SDGs based on the volunteers' prior knowledge.

In each exercise, the volunteer is presented with a text and an associated SDG label (which generally originates from the source) and is asked to either accept or reject the proposed label.

The citizen science project outputs are [already available to the research community](https://zenodo.org/record/5792547) and are updated on a quarterly basis. This data can be used to derive insights into the nature of SDGs using either ontology-based or machine learning approaches.
