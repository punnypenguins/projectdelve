## Dingo? Bingo!

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/neiljordan/dingo-bingo).

### Overview

The Myall Lakes Dingo Project aims to develop and test non-lethal tools for dingo management, and to further our understanding and appreciation of this iconic Australian carnivore.

We have 64 camera-traps across our study site, and need your help to identify the animals they detect - including dingoes.

Dingoes are an iconic, but controversial part of the Australian ecosystem. Their interactions with humans and livestock have led to massive efforts to manage them; from the world's longest fence to widespread culling. Yet dingoes may play an important role as an apex predator in the landscape by regulating populations of smaller introduced predators, as well as herbivores.

We are testing whether scents and sounds deter dingoes from specific areas. The idea is to develop a tool that can be used elsewhere to reduce negative impacts. We hope to tap into the dingoes' own signals to create our deterrent.
