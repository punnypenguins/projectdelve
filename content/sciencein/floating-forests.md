## Floating Forests

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/floating-forests).

### Overview

Welcome to Floating Forests, where you can help us uncover the history of Giant Kelp forests around the globe. Most life on the seafloor can only be sampled by SCUBA divers or dredging up samples from the deep. This kind of data requires a ton of (really fun) effort to collect, but it means weâ€™re limited to places we can get to! Given the worldwide distribution of kelp, we need your help to track it across time and space.
