## Notes from Nature - Flora of Texas and Oklahoma

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/md68135/notes-from-nature-flora-of-texas-and-oklahoma).

### Overview

Naturalists and Scientists have been exploring Nature for centuries, collecting a massive amount of specimens over the course of many lifetimes. While this meticulous work has resulted in more than 3 million botanical specimens being housed in herbaria across Texas and Oklahoma, only a small fraction of this treasure is digitally accessible for observation, or for inclusion in scientific studies.

The goal of our project is to bring these fascinating plant specimens -- and the information they hold -- to light. When you join our Expedition, you will help extract the data associated with them, by transcribing the valuable label information each specimen sheet. This way, it will be available for scientists and the general public to utilize.

Through an eclectic mix of plants collected across the diverse history and landscapes of our two States, you can do some virtual botanizing and delve into the richness of Texas and Oklahoma botany!
