## PROJECT NAME

View the project [**here**](https://eyewire.org/explore).

### Overview

[Eyewire](https://eyewire.org/explore) is a game to map the brain. Anyone can play and you need no scientific background. Hundreds of thousands of people from around the world already do. Together we are mapping the 3D structure of neurons and advancing our quest to understand ourselves.

By joining Eyewire, you can help map the [connectome](https://blog.eyewire.org/i-am-my-connectome/), starting with connections between retinal neurons. Eyewire gameplay advances neuroscience by helping researchers discover how neurons connect and network to process information. You also help develop advanced artificial intelligence and computational technologies for mapping the connectome.

Players in Eyewire have charted never-before-known circuits and discovered six new types of neurons, which they were later able to name. Check out our publications [here](https://seunglab.org/publications/).

> You can read a great explanation of the [science of brain mapping](https://science.eyewire.org/) that Eyewire is based on, and explore [neurons discovered by people like you](http://museum.eyewire.org/?neurons=26065,20117,26051,17212), too!
