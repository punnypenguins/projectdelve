## Seabird Soundscapes

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/intrepidgannet/seabird-soundscapes).

### Overview

Join our team of citizen-scientists and help us explore the marine soundscapes of wild seabirds by listening to and classifying the sounds they make at sea.

Seabird Soundscapes is about expanding our understanding about seabird life at sea by exploring their marine soundscapes. When seabirds move, feed, vocalise and interact with their surroundings they produce sounds that help us learn about the activities they engage with in their environments. Likewise, natural and manmade sounds create a diverse acoustic ambient that help build the context in which seabirds exist.

Volunteer citizen-scientists can help analyse the collected data and unveil the seabird soundscapes by listening and visualising the 10-second sound extracts in the CLASSIFY page, then identify and classify each recording by choosing one or more options from the task tabs.
