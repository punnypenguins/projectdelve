## Buzzy Bee - African Canopy Pollinators

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/obhasin/buzzy-bee-african-canopy-pollinators).

### Overview

Help us identify insect pollinators of large African timber trees!

In order to define sustainable exploitation practices, it is necessary to understand regeneration cycles of timber tree species. The purpose of this research is to describe the relationship between pollen dispersal distances, floral traits, and pollinators of several timber species, as well as document the size and composition of pollinators communities. For this, we have been collecting ecological, genetic and behavioral data from different timber trees and their circulating entomofauna in three areas of tropical rainforest in Cameroon and Gabon.
