## Cosmic Muon Images

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/reinforce/cosmic-muon-images).

### Overview

We place muon detectors all around the globe and we study the inner structure of massive objects from volcanoes to ancient tombs and from underground tunnels to blast furnaces.

Using muon tomography we can probe the internal structure of massive objects, like volcanoes, with particles from stars and galaxies far, far away. Help us identify these particles inside our detectors!
