## Frog Find

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ollibruuh/frog-find).

### Overview

Help us find threatened frogs in NSW National Parks. Understanding where they live helps us improve their chance of survival in the future.

Frogs need your help! Following bushfires, floods and a host of other threats including water pollution and disease, our frogs really have their back against the wall.

Frog Find uses frog sounds recorded from streams, ponds and wetlands to work out who is calling where. We have put recorders in places where frogs were historically detected and new places where we might expect to find them. Now we need your ears to help us in this detective work!

In just 30 seconds you can tell us whether there is a threatened frog calling at one of our sites! And you don’t need to be an expert – we will help you along the way. Thanks to the help of local community groups we have been able to increase our monitoring programs to include areas in and around national parks and even right in people’s backyards!
