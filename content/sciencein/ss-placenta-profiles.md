## Science Scribbler: Placenta Profiles

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/msbrhonclif/science-scribbler-placenta-profiles).

### Overview

Help us understand mitochondrial dynamics in the placenta, and train computers to analyse new data even faster in the future!

The placenta is the organ that connects a mother to her baby during pregnancy and enables the baby to grow. This vital organ has many essential jobs to do such as transferring oxygen and nutrients from the mother to her growing baby. If the placenta fails to work properly it can lead to pregnancy complications where the baby can be born too small, too early, is very unwell, or does not survive. Understanding why placentas fail will help us to understand why some pregnancies suffer complications. How well the placenta works is related to its development and structure. However, the structure of the placenta is difficult to study because there are lots of different cell types. Placenta Profiles is a project that aims to explore in detail the complex structure of the placenta.
