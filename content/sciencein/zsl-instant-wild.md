## ZSL's Instant Wild

View the project [**here**](https://instantwild.zsl.org/intro).

### Overview

ZSL’s Instant Wild empowers you to take part in vital conservation work, bringing you LIVE images and videos from amazing locations all around the world. By identifying the animals in each image, you are contributing to conservation and making a positive impact on the future for wildlife.

Motion triggered cameras are a crucial tool for monitoring animal populations and movements, and this information allows us to develop methods for conserving them. As an animal moves past one of our Instant Wild cameras it will trigger, taking a photo which is immediately sent back to the app in real time for identification by you. Identifying thousands of images takes time but with your help we can identify even more species and help to protect them.

You don’t need any qualifications or special expertise to take part – lots of help is provided to make sure you make the right identification – simply sign up and start tagging the animals in the images.

Your involvement will not only contribute to conservation, making you part of our ZSL community, you’ll also get a window into the some of the world’s wildest places.

All projects can be found listed [on this page](https://instantwild.zsl.org/projects).
