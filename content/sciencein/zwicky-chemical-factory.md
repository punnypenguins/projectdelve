## Zwicky Chemical Factory

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/adamamiller/zwicky-chemical-factory).

### Overview

Every year astronomers discover thousands of new supernovae (exploding stars). Once these spectacular events are found, we use spectroscopy to understand the chemical elements in the explosion and what type of star exploded. Help us classify these explosions!

The elements created by an individual supernova (SN) differ depending on the type of SN (for example, oxygen and sodium are primarily created when massive stars explode, whereas iron is primarily created when white dwarf stars explode). When ZTF discovers a new SN, all we know is that a star has exploded. We need to take a spectrum in order to identify the type of explosion, and hence the elements that have been created.

If we can manage to classify every SN found by ZTF, that will allow us to undertake a wide range of investigations to:

- understand the origin of elements throughout the universe
- understand how massive stars end their lives
- understand how binary stars interact, and why some explode (and others don't)
- understand why and how galaxies stop forming new stars
