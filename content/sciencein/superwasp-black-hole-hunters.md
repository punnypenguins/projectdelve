## SuperWASP: Black Hole Hunters

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/hughdickinson/superwasp-black-hole-hunters).

### Overview

SuperWASP is the Wide Angle Search for Planets; due to the combination of sky coverage (all latitudes above and below the Galactic plane), observing cadence (how regularly each star is observed) and long temporal baseline (the overall lengths of the lightcurves for each star) the archive is the ideal place to start searching for periodic lensing on the timescales of hours to years.

The signals you're looking for are extremely rare. Even though we think there are lots of hidden black holes in our galaxy, only a handful will be orbiting in a plane that means they pass in front of their companion star when viewed from the Earth using SuperWASP. The rarity of these perfectly aligned systems means we will be lucky if we find a handful of signals among the millions of stellar lightcurves that SuperWASP has assembled. So far, nobody has seen conclusive evidence of a self-lensing signal from a black hole. If you help to find one you will be making science history!
