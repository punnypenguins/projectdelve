## Smoke Sense Study

View the project [**here**](https://www.epa.gov/air-research/smoke-sense-study-citizen-science-project-using-mobile-app).

### Overview

Smoke Sense is a crowdsourcing, citizen science research project developed by EPA researchers focused on increasing public awareness and engagement related to wildfire smoke health risks. Specifically, EPA wants to understand the extent that exposure to wildland fire smoke affects health and productivity, discover what steps people are willing to take to reduce their exposure, and develop health risk communication strategies that improve public health when there is wildfire smoke.

Individuals can learn about current and future air quality and wildland fires in their area as well as smoke health risks by downloading and using the app. Users can also report their health symptoms, and the range of actions they are able or willing to take to improve their health condition or lower their exposure to wildfire smoke.â€¯Users will also earn in-app badges for participating.

Available on the App Store and Google Play Store.
