## Unfolding of Microplant Mysteries

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nvuitton/unfolding-of-microplant-mysteries).

### Overview

‘Microplants’ are often tiny plants, technically called bryophytes, and are the second largest group after flowering plants. Despite their small size microplants are vital in our understanding of the evolutionary history of plants and are of great ecological and environmental significance. Because of their small size, they are often overlooked in many habitats throughout the world. Many new species remain to be discovered! Please help classify microplants morphology: the study of the form of organisms and their specific structural features. This mystery will explore key morphological characteristics associated with the liverwort genus called *Frullania*.
