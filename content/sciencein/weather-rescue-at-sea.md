## Weather Rescue At Sea

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/p-teleti/weather-rescue-at-sea).

### Overview

The aim of the *Weather Rescue At Sea* project is to construct and extended the global surface temperature record back to the 1780s, based on the air temperature observations recorded across the planet.

This will be achieved by crowd-sourcing the recovery (or data rescue) of the weather observations from historical ship logbooks, station records, weather journals and other sources, to produce a longer, and more consistent dataset of global surface temperature.

Help us better understand our changing climate by transcribing ship weather logbooks from the early industrial era!
