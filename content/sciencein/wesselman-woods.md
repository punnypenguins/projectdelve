### Overview

Want an exclusive view of the largest urban old-growth forest in the U.S? Take a closer look at urban wildlife activity through this camera trap project by joining our citizen science team and helping us tag pictures and contribute to urban ecology theory!

Wesselman Woods is home to the largest urban old-growth forest in the U.S with over 200 acres of land, making this camera trap project like none other. This project is composed of 9 cameras around various locations in the nature preserve. Cameras are placed on trees near corridors or "wildlife highways" where wildlife is most likely to traverse. These cameras are deployed four times a year during the months of January, April, July, and October. During these months, the cameras run continuously for 30 days. After these deployment periods, we often capture thousands of photos to upload onto this project page. Because our research team is so small, we really depend on citizen scientists and volunteers to help us go through the photo tagging process.
