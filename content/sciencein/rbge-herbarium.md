## The RBGE Herbarium: Exploring Gesneriaceae, the African violet family

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/emhaston/the-rbge-herbarium-exploring-gesneriaceae-the-african-violet-family).

### Overview

Open up global biodiversity research possibilities by releasing the data held in 300 years of plant specimens!

The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh's extensive Herbarium collection is estimated to hold three million specimens **representing half to two thirds of the worlds flora.** Herbarium specimen data helps inform and target conservation and climate change mitigation efforts protecting plant species for future generations. We need your help in transcribing the specimen label data in order to make the digital specimens 'research-ready' for the international research community.

By volunteering on this Zooniverse project, you’ll also be supporting an overarching project that studies how volunteers interact with citizen research projects -- Engaging Crowds: citizen research and heritage data at scale, is part of Towards a National Collection, an £18.9 million Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded programme which launched in 2020. As one of the programme’s foundational projects, this open-source research will benefit society more widely in showing how volunteers interact with projects and how citizens can change the future of research.
