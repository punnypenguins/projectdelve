## Nest Quest Go: Mourning Doves

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/brbcornell/nest-quest-go-mourning-doves).

### Overview

Join the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Citizen-Science Project, [NestWatch](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/brbcornell/nest-quest-go-mourning-doves), in understanding the historical nesting patterns of Mourning Doves. In North America, Mourning Doves are the most abundant and widespread game bird.

While they are hunted in North America, these nest-record cards demonstrate a different kind of hunting: the quest for data!

These nest record cards are a subset of a larger collection of more than 300,000 nest records that NestWatch is working on digitizing and transcribing. Valuable scientific questions can be asked and answered regarding the nesting behavior of birds over time by examining historical records. We hope to bring new discoveries to light using these previously hidden datasets.
