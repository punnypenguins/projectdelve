## Manatee Chat

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/cetalingua/manatee-chat).

### Overview

Manatee acoustic communication has not been studied extensively because it has been believed that manatees have a very limited communication system, which acts mainly as a contact call between a mother and calf. This project will investigate the form and function of manatee vocalizations, and it will allow us to learn more about what signals manatees produce, what potential function they might serve, and what differences individual manatee calls have.

The project's overall goal is to analyze the acoustic (and later video) data sets with the help of citizen scientists. Part of this analysis will be used to train a deep learning system to identify and classify manatee calls. This is phase one of the project in which the citizen scientists are asked to identify and count manatee calls.
