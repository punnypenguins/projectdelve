## Steelpan Vibrations

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/achmorrison/steelpan-vibrations).

### Overview

The distinct sound of the Caribbean steelpan is due largely to the interconnections between notes on the pan. We need help classifying vibration patterns so that we can learn more about how this drum works.

We have maps of the vibration of steelpans taken with a high speed camera at up to 30000 frames per second. We need the help of volunteers to help us map the data!
