## PROJECT NAME

View the project [**here**](https://fairchildgarden.org/gbe/growing-beyond-earth-2021-2022/) (2021-2022 page) and [**here**](https://fairchildgarden.org/gbe/) (main page).

### Overview

*NOTE: While the project is already underway for the 2021-2022 school year, this is an annually recurring project that has been going for six years already and will absolutely run again next year. If you are interested in having your class participate

Growing Beyond Earth® (GBE) is a classroom-based citizen science project operated in partnership with NASA. It includes a series of plant experiments conducted by students using equipment similar to the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) on the International Space Station.

With experiments currently in progress in more than 250 middle and high schools across the country, GBE is providing a steady stream of valuable data to NASA scientists who are developing technologies for growing food crops for long-duration missions into deep space.

**YOUR CHALLENGE:** The search for the perfect food plants to feed astronauts is an ongoing effort. For the past seven years, students from across the country have been helping us provide NASA scientists with data on the best candidates and innovative ideas to improve growing conditions for long-distance space travel. This year we’re exploring radishes. This promising crop produces large amounts of edible biomass (you can eat both the roots and leaves), contains valuable nutrients, and certain varieties mature quickly. Your challenge is to test an assortment of radish cultivars in Trial 1 and apply what you learn to design a second trial that optimizes the radish growing conditions to maximize yield.

**CHAT WITH A SCIENTIST:** We will be hosting an OPTIONAL online chat with NASA scientists about the Growing Beyond Earth project. Teachers participating in GBE will receive an invitation a week before each chat with instructions on how to participate. See below for a list of scheduled dates and recordings:
- ~~Thursday, October 21 at 4:00 pm ET – NEW!~~
- Thursday, **November 18** at 4:00 pm ET
- Thursday, **January 20** at 4:00 pm ET
