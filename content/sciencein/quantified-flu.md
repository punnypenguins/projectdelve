## Quantified Flu

View the project [**here**](https://quantifiedflu.org/).

### Overview

The question we want to answer is: Can the various physiological parameters tracked by our wearables help to predict when weâ€™re getting sick? With the COVID-19 pandemic influencing all of our lives right now, this question seems more timely than ever. But it's not only the pandemic, this question equally applies to the flu and the common cold!

There is some preliminary data which shows that the data from wearables (like resting heart rate and sleep quality) might be predictive of coming down with a cold. Which offers a great opportunity for a collective citizen science approach!

Do you have a wearable that you use regularly? And maybe even have used it in the past, while you were sick? We would love to collect those data and analyze them with your help!

There are two ways you can use Quantified Flu:
1. Report past illnesses: Report when you got sick in the past and share your wearable device data. We'll make a plot of your data for you!
2. Track symptoms going forward: Sign up for daily check-ins to tell us if you got sick, your symptoms and viral test results.

In the longer run we want to use these data to learn whether all those wearable signals can be used to train algorithms to predict when someone is falling sick, before the person is even consciously aware of it.
