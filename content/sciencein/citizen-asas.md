## Citizen ASAS-SN

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tharinduj/citizen-asas-sn).

### Overview

Classify the light curves of variable stars and help us find the most unusual ones!

Variable stars are useful astrophysical tools that have been used to study the evolution of stars, the structure of our Galaxy and they also form a rung in the astrophysical distance ladder to nearby star clusters and galaxies.

The goal of this project is to classify the light curves of variable stars identified in the ASAS-SN g-band data.

By classifying these light curves, you will help scientists better understand the population of variable stars in our Galaxy. Through your efforts, we also hope to identify unusual variables that inform us of the peculiar ways that some stars behave in.

Using 20 robotic telescopes distributed worldwide, The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) automatically surveys the entire visible sky every night down to about 18th magnitude in the g-band.

ASAS-SN measures the brightness of about ~100 million stars over time. Using the light curves of these stars, scientists can study their variability properties.
