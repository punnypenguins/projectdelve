## Deep Sea Explorers

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/reinforce/deep-sea-explorers).

### Overview

Help us to study bio-activity in the deep sea! With your help, we will better understand marine sources of noise in the KM3NeT detector, making our search for neutrinos much easier.

**Wait... What? We can do sea science with a neutrino telescope?!**

Neutrinos are very peculiar elementary particles. Even if we have come to know a lot more about them since their first prediction in 1930 and their first experimental detection in 1956, we still don't fully understand them. Why? Mainly because they are very (very!) difficult to detect.

To increase our chances of seeing them, we need huge detectors. And by huge we mean at the km3 scale. Neutrino detection relies on the observation of Cherenkov light, which can easily be seen in transparent media like water or ice. That is why KM3NeT, the Kilometer Cube Neutrino Telescope, is currently deployed in the Mediterranean sea.

Unfortunately, sea water has some drawbacks, which we call noises. We want to get rid of them, in order to improve our detection of neutrinos. This is where we need you! One of our main sources of noise comes from bio-activity in the deep sea, in the form of light and acoustic signals that have never been systematically studied.

Your mission as a Deep Sea Hunter (should you choose to accept it!) is to help computers to better classify these light and acoustic signals. While computers might outshine us in analysing very large datasets, human eyes and ears are still better than a computer at noticing subtleties.
