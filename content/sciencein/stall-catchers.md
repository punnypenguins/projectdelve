## Stall Catchers

### Overview

Stall Catchers (formerly "EyesOnALZ") is a citizen science project developed by the Human Computation Institute. The project enables everyone to contribute to Alzheimer’s disease research and speed up the search for a treatment. Stall Catchers, our first Citizen Science game, was launched in October 2016 and now gathers thousands of volunteers.

Stall Catchers is an online game that anyone can play - no experience necessary. In the game, you look at movies from the brains of mice and try to identify vessels as flowing or stalled. This helps to speed up Alzheimer's disease research at Cornell University.

Stall Catchers was built on one of the oldest volunteer thinking projects: stardust@home, and is using the Virtual Microscope developed by their team. Who knew stardust and blood vessels could be so similar?

Currently, our catchers range from 6 to 88 years old. Large part of our community includes middle school students, seniors, caregivers and Alzheimer’s patients themselves.

The game is easy to grasp, and we walk you through in the beginning. Check out the "How to" section in the main menu if you need help at any time. Don't worry about making mistakes - each blood vessel is analysed by multiple catchers, and we ensure we generate reliable crowd answers in the end.
