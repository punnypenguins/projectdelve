## Notes From Nature - Southeastern U.S. Biodiversity

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/md68135/notes-from-nature-southeastern-us-biodiversity).

### Overview

Digitizing data of southeast United States species allows comparisons of geographic distributions and niche specificity between endemic vascular plant species and non-endemics – essential to characterize and manage a significant component of this nation’s biodiversity imperiled by the effects of climate change, the loss of native habitat to anthropogenic uses, and biotic invasions.

Researchers can utilize herbarium specimen data to model current and future distributions of rare and endemic species. Conservation management in the face of climate change requires new strategies; previously suitable natural habitat may become uninhabitable even if preserved as a conservation easement or biological reserve. In addition, herbaria can be one of the most efficient places to search for new species.

We believe it is critically important to expose data in small and mid-sized collections, with potentially unique specimens and certainly less well-studied specimens than large collections.
