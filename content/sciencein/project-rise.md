## Project RISE

View the project [**here**](https://smoke.createlab.org/label.html

### Overview

Project RISE, initiated by the CMU CREATE Lab, aims to train an Artificial Intelligence model to Recognize Industrial Smoke Emissions, and we need volunteers to help label smoke emissions. So far, 22099 (23.05%) videos are fully labeled. We would greatly appreciate your participation in this community-powered AI research!

Our goal is to invite citizens in creating data-driven evidence that shows the pollution source (using the smoke emissions found by the AI model) and its impact on the community (using Smell Pittsburgh). We hope that this evidence can facilitate air quality advocacy in Pittsburgh and also other regions.

The GitHub repository for this project can be found [**here**](https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/deep-smoke-machine).
