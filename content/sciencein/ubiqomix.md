## UbiQomix Microbiome Exploration

View the project [**here**](https://www.openhumans.org/activity/ubiqomix-microbiome-exploration/).

### Overview

Questions about how people make sense of and engage with their personal omic information including their personal genomics and microbiome data, and how comfortable they feel about sharing such information in order to advance scientific and biomedical research, are not only of paramount importance for society and policy makers, but also a pressing issue for HCI researchers. Funded by the National Science Foundation, and in collaboration with Open Humans, we investigate how to design effective interaction techniques to empower nonexpert users to engage with and make sense of their personal omic information. We also explore how user interface design interventions in online consent forms can support informed decision and enable participants of biomedical research to make decisions that are right for them.

Do you have microbiome data?

Help us understand how to help people capture, visualize, and engage with their microbiome data. At this stage of the project, we seek to better understand peopleâ€™s needs and practices as they engage with their personal microbiome data. The long-term goal of this project is to design more novel interactive tools that promote exploration, collaborative sense-making, sharing, and citizen science initiatives related to genetics and microbiome data.

After joining this project, we will ask you to answer a questionnaire about your experience engaging with your personal microbiome data. This should take about 15 minutes.
