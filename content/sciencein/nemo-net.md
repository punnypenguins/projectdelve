## PROJECT NAME

View the project [**here**](http://nemonet.info/).

### Overview

NeMO-Net is a single player iPad game where players help NASA classify coral reefs by painting 3D and 2D images of coral. Players can rate the classifications of other players and level up in the food chain as they explore and classify coral reefs and other shallow marine environments and creatures from locations all over the world!

Data from the NeMO-Net game is fed to NASA NeMO-Net, the first neural multi-modal observation and training network for global coral reef assessment. NeMO-Net is an opensource deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that leverages NASAâ€™s Supercomputer, Pleiades, to use game data to classify and assess the health of coral reefs around the world.
