## You see it? You name it!

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/vborghesani/you-see-it-you-name-it).

### Overview

One of our goals is to provide cognitive neuroscience and machine learning researchers with high quality stimuli. One issue both community face is in fact the lack of freely available large set of images appropriately curated by humans. This is were anyone can help and become part of an international and interdisciplinary scientific effort! We here present tons of pictures and ask volunteers to name the main item in the image (e.g., that's a cat!) and to assign a categorical label (e.g., that's an animal!). The resulting hundreds of images with quality labels will be instrumental for many research on the cognitive and neural correlates of vision and semantic (e.g., how does our brain decide so quickly whether to run towards or away from that animal?). Moreover, they will enable testing of computer models aiming at replicating human performance in this kind of tasks.
