## Algal Blooms: Water Color

View the project [**here**](https://cartosco.pe/kioskProject.html#/kioskStart/ASNWK1dZEY1z).

### Overview

Organized by a pilot and a NASA scientist, Dr. Rafat Ansari, this project coordinates volunteer pilots from around the country to fly over and photograph bodies of water that are prone to algal blooms outbreaks. Toxic Algae pose serious problems to human health, fish, and recreation industry. The economic damage to commercial fishing is $100 million and rising (NOAA). There are 600,000 private pilots in the U.S. and over 200,000 general aviation (GA) aircraft. Aerial images can be used to study water quality scientific issues in aquatic systems. Working together with Cartoscope, the Algal Bloom Project enables the public to help analyze the aerial images and form an early warning system for algal blooms.
