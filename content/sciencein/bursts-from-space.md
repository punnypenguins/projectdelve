## Bursts from Space

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mikewalmsley/bursts-from-space).

### Overview

Fast Radio Bursts are massive bursts of energy we see from across half the universe. We call them Fast Radio Bursts because that's what we see - a brief millisecond 'burst' of energy in radio waves.

What are they? We don't know! But every burst we find tells us a little more about what's happening. We need to find these bursts!

Sounds easy right? Just look for bright bursts of radio. Unfortunately, we humans also like to produce bright, short radio signals. We need your help to sort through our signals -- are they from humans, or from space?

Most weeks, on Thursday around 2pm UTC, we'll bring you brand new data from the telescope. You might be the first person to find a new fast radio burst!

We'll use your classifications to find more fast radio bursts and discover where they come from.
