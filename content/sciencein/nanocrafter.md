## Nanocrafter

View the project [**here**](https://nanocrafter.org/).

### Overview

The field of synthetic biology has grown to a multibillion-dollar market as a result of how broad the applications are. From terraforming to fighting viruses! One of the avenues of synthetic biology, and the focus of Nanocrafter, is using synthesized DNA to create biological machines.

But actually building the DNA components in real life isn’t very easy, although the price has gone down drastically. Normally, scientists and researchers work with digital models, which will then have to go through a long process before being accepted for synthesis. It’s a process with a strict aim and goal for everyone involved.

Nanocrafter’s goal is to crowdsource creation of interesting digital models and use the same player base to select interesting DNA components. Unlike [Foldit](https://fold.it/), there are no set objectives for players to achieve – it’s simply about finding out what can be done with the DNA fragments we are currently able to synthesize.

There’s no shortage of simple puzzle games out there, but Nanocrafter has the exciting advantage of letting you build real world solutions to very real problems, potentially. Among the user projects already submitted, you can find things like self-assembling chains, biological sensors and even logic gates, which are essential pieces for computing.

As one of the first citizen science games created without a particular goal in mind, it’ll be exciting to see what the users will eventually come up with. Foldit has had an impressive list of accomplishments, and outperformed computed solutions in many ways. It wouldn’t be surprising to see something completely new come out of Nanocrafter in the next few years.
