## Radio JOVE

View the project [**here**](https://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.php).

### Overview

Radio JOVE students and amateur scientists from around the world observe and analyze natural radio emissions of Jupiter, the Sun, and our galaxy building their own radio telescope from an easy to build kit or using remote radio telescopes through the Internet.

- Build and use your own Decametric Radio Telescope
- Share your observations with other project members
- Teachers, See Our Lesson Ideas and other Educational Materials

There is much more to astronomy than what can be learned by peering at the skies through an optical telescope! The Radio JOVE project has developed a modest cost radio telescope kit to open the realm of long wavelength radio observations to the general public. The Radio JOVE radio telescope is used to receive decameter-wavelength radio emissions from the Sun, the planet Jupiter, the Galaxy, and the Earth. Science can be achieved as the signals are recorded, displayed, analyzed and archived using Radio JOVE software.

See [Radio JOVE Kits](https://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/kits/) for more on the radio telescope kit options and ordering.

The Radio JOVE project welcomes teachers, students, amateur scientists, ham radio operators and anyone interested in learning more about radio astronomy. You can build our radio telescope kit, use your own equipment, or just join in via the Internet. One of our main goals is to motivate students to learn about science by participating in a scientific activity, making measurements, acquiring and analyzing data, and sharing and discussing their results with other observers.
