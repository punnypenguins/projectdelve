## Spyfish Aotearoa

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/victorav/spyfish-aotearoa).

### Overview

Our team deploys baited underwater cameras in marine reserves all over Aotearoa New Zealand to monitor the abundance and diversity of marine life.
Help us identify and count the species of fish recorded by the cameras. Your classifications will be used to determine the effectiveness of the reserves, inform marine management, and protect our taonga (treasured) species.
