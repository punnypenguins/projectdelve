## Swipes for Science

View the project [**here**](https://github.com/SwipesForScience/SwipesForScience/blob/master/README.md).

### Overview

**The problem**
- Big data in biomedical research needs individual inspection, but this doesn’t scale for large datasets.
- For example, some researchers analyze MRI images to study the brain. But before they start the analysis, they have to visually inspect each image to make sure it is good quality. And at various stages in data processing, researchers have to check images to make sure the analysis is correct. This can get really unweildy when we have large datasets, which are needed to really understand the brain.
- Citizen science games like EyeWire have been really successful for brain analysis, but it is built for one specific type of data, and its really hard to adapt for a different use-case.
- Researchers need a way to easily spin up a citizen science game for their own large datasets, ideally without needing to know web-development (so they can focus on research!)

**The solution**

The SwipesForScience game template will:
- Generate a game from a configuration file provided by a researcher
- The game should be easy to deploy online, and require very little knowledge of web technologies/cloud technologies
- Be fun and easy for citizen scientists to use

We need expertise in app development, user experience design, database maintenance, software sustainability, documentation, technical writing, and project management.

Our primary goal is to make it extremely easy for researchers to set up their own data-annotation game. This means that we need to simplify the dev-ops parts of setup, and we need very clear documentation. We also want to design annotation widgets that are easy and fun to use, so that citizen scientists enjoy playing these games.

If you think you can help in any of the areas listed above (and we bet you can) or in any of the many areas that we haven't yet thought of (and here we're sure you can) then please check out our [contributors' guidelines](https://github.com/SwipesForScience/SwipesForScience/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [roadmap](https://github.com/SwipesForScience/SwipesForScience/issues/16).
