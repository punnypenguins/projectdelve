## Eterna

View the project [**here**](https://eternagame.org/).

### Overview

Design molecular medicines by solving puzzles!

Eterna is a game that allows players to design RNAs by solving puzzles. Each puzzle represents a target RNA shape or a set of design requirements. Players design the pattern of bases they think will best meet the requirements. Scientists then create the molecules the players have designed and test them in the lab. The lab results are returned to the players, who can use them to improve their designs.

Eterna players have shown that they can beat supercomputers as well as research teams in designing new RNAs. Working together, players and researchers can find novel solutions, invent new medicines, and unravel the secrets of RNA.
