## Prickly Pear Project Kenya

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/peter-dot-stewart/prickly-pear-project-kenya).

### Overview

Prickly pear cacti (Opuntia sp.) are one of the worst invasive plants in East Africa. We are a team of researchers from Durham University (UK) and Mpala Research Centre (Kenya) using camera traps to understand how Opuntia affects the habitat use of medium to large mammal species. This research has important implications for human-wildlife conflict and the future spread of the cactus.

By classifying the animals in our camera trap photos, you are helping us to understand the impacts of Opuntia so that we can predict and manage them more effectively.
