## Notes From Nature - Herbarium

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/md68135/notes-from-nature-herbarium).

### Overview

Welcome to the Herbarium Project on Notes from Nature. We will be hosting lots of great expeditions related to plants on this Project from a variety of institutions.

For the time being these will be mostly specimens related to the from the [NitFix project](https://nitfix.org/).

The NitFix project received funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop mechanisms to engineer bioenergy crops so that these plants can fix nitrogen via root nodule symbioses. If we are successful, engineered bioenergy crops could be cultivated in marginal lands that have little agricultural value due to poor soil or other characteristics.
