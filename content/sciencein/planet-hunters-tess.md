## Planet Hunters TESS

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess).

### Overview

The recently launched Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is providing us with a huge amount of data that lets us look for planets outside of our own Solar System, including planets that could support life. With your help, we are going to find planets that will help us understand how these extrasolar systems form and evolve over time. The results may even bring us closer to answering the question that we all want to answer: Are we alone in the Universe?
