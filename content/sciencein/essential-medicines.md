## E$$ENTIAL MEDICINES

View the project [**here**](https://www.breakinggoodproject.com/essentialmedicines).

### Overview

The E$$ENTIAL MEDICINE$ project focuses on the medicines that the World Health Organisation (WHO) prioritises as the most important medicines.

We think that everyone should have access to the world’s most important medicines but unfortunately, this is not our reality. We’d like to change this and we need your help! Help us build a greater understanding of global access to the essential medicines.

Breaking Good is an international citizen science initiative that empowers members of the public to be active researchers in projects that will improve human health. Through hands-on engagement and authentic chemistry and health research, Breaking Good promotes STEM to young people and involves them in the drug discovery process as part of open science consortiums. Students conduct online research and chemical synthesis with the goal of replicating important medicines that are aren’t accessible and creating new ones.
