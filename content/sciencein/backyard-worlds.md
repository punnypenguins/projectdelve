## Backyard Worlds: Planet 9

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/marckuchner/backyard-worlds-planet-9).

### Overview

Is there a large planet at the fringes of our solar system awaiting discovery, a world astronomers call Planet Nine? Weâ€™re looking for this planet and for new brown dwarfs in the backyard of the solar system using data from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission. But we need your help!

Finding these dim objects requires combing through the images by eye to distinguish moving celestial bodies from ghosts and other artifacts. There are too many images for us to search through by ourselves. So come join the search, and you might find a rogue world that's nearer to the Sun than Proxima Centauri---or even the elusive Planet Nine.
