## Brain Explorer

View the project [**here**](https://brainexplorer.net/).

### Overview

We are interested how our brains develop during adolescence and throughout our lifetimes. We want to understand why most mental health problems, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), emerge during adolescence. By playing the games on our app, you will help us to understand how different brain mechanisms influence how we think and feel. This will allow us to better understand how brain processes are linked to mental health problems and may help to find new treatments.

This is a ‘citizen science’ project. This means that everyone can take part and contribute valuable information for our research. We will use statistics, computer models and machine learning to analyse the information from the app and to investigate the brain mechanisms underlying our behaviours. This will allow us to find new and important associations between the brain and mental health.

Everyone aged 9 years or older is invited to take part! The games are fun for all ages and everyone who plays will help us to understand how the brain works! If you are below 16, then we will ask your parents or guardians to let us know that they are happy for you to play our games.
