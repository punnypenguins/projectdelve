## The Indy Wildlife Watch: An Initiative of the CUES

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/cuebutler/the-indy-wildlife-watch-an-initiative-of-the-cues).

### Overview

Join the Center for Urban Ecology and Sustainability (CUES) at Butler University and the Indianapolis Zoo by tagging animals in our photos!

Urbanization describes a human population shift from rural areas to cities, which usually results in the physical growth of urban areas.

As the global population of humans continues to grow, so will the rate of urbanization. The goal of the Indy Wildlife Watch project is to better understand the impacts of urbanization on local wildlife diversity and what urban habitats they utilize. We accomplish this by setting up motion-triggered cameras along an urban-to-rural gradient in the city of Indianapolis.

Our primary research questions include:

- What animals live in our city?
- Where and when do they move around the city?
- What type of habitat do they use?
- What interactions are present between animals?

This project is part of a growing international project of over 25 cities collecting data in the same way. This larger network of sites, called the Urban Wildlife Information Network, is managed by the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, Illinois.
