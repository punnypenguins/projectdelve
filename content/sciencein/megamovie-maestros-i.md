## Megamovie Maestros I

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/robertlet/megamovie-maestros-i).

### Overview

Help us improve the Eclipse Megamovie by analyzing photos from the 2017 total solar eclipse taken by thousands of citizen scientists!

Megamovie Maestros I is part of the [Eclipse Megamovie Project](http://eclipsemegamovie.org/), a first-of-its-kind citizen science project that enlisted thousands of volunteers from locations across the United States to capture images of the August 21, 2017 total solar eclipse. We have collected [over 50,000 images], and now we need your help analyzing them! In this first project, you will help us determine what our volunteers actually captured by identifying eclipse phases and other phenomenon of interest.
