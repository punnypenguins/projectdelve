## GWitchHunters

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/reinforce/gwitchhunters).

### Overview

GWITCHHUNTERS aims at improving the performance of current Gravitational Wave detectors in the experimental study of the Universe. Such instruments have reached extraordinary sensitivities to accomplish this task, but they are also very delicate and prone to spurious disturbances of non-astrophysical origin.
Our goal is to better understand their disturbances and find new solutions to them.

We are a team of researchers devoted to this very challenging task, involving state of the art technologies and analysis methods. It is not a simple one though, because of the extreme complexity of the apparatuses and their interconnections. For this reason, we need your help to join us in the exciting endeavour of Gravitational Wave research!
