## PROJECT NAME

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/) (for desktop users) and its mobile version (for Android and iPhone) [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mikewalmsley/galaxy-zoo-mobile).

### Overview

To understand how galaxies formed we need your help to classify them according to their shapes. If you're quick, you may even be the first person to see the galaxies you're asked to classify.

Welcome to Galaxy Zoo's latest incarnation. For more than a decade, we've asked volunteers to help us explore galaxies near and far, sampling a fraction of the roughly one hundred billion that are scattered throughout the observable Universe. Each one of the systems, containing billions of stars, has had a unique life, interacting with its surroundings and with other galaxies in many different ways; the aim of the Galaxy Zoo team is to try and understand these processes, and to work out what galaxies can tell us about the past, present and future of the Universe as a whole.
