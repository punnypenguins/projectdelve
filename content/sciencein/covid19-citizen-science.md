## COVID-19 Citizen Science

View the project [**here**](https://covid19.eurekaplatform.org/).

### Overview

Everyone 18+ years old with an internet connection can participate, whether or not you have been tested for COVID-19!

Fight COVID-19 in 5 minutes a day!
- Identify symptoms
- Help prevent infection
- Track the impact

This study is important to help us discover how COVID-19 is spreading throughout the world, and ways to predict and prevent further infections.

We’ll ask you some questions each day and invite you to participate in OPTIONAL study opportunities, like connecting other apps and smartphone GPS. In the future, we may also ask you to join other studies. We’ll notify you via push notification on your smartphone, email, and/or text message when new survey questions or other study activities are open to you. Sign up and your first set of surveys will take about 20-25 minutes, and then we’ll ask for about 5-15 more minutes of your time per week.

By participating, you will help us contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 and find better ways to predict, prevent, and treat COVID-19.
