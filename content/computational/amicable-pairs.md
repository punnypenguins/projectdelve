## Amicable Pairs

View the project [**here**](https://sech.me/boinc/Amicable/).

### Overview

Though mathematics is not an experimental science, mathematicians often look for examples to test conjectures (which they then hope to prove). As the number of examples increases, so does (in a sense) their understanding of the distribution.

The goal is to collect all amicable numbers up to a very large limit. This data will facilitate theoretical research in the field: [1](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/Amicable1.pdf), [2](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/Amicable2.pdf), [3](https://math.dartmouth.edu/theses/undergrad/2014/Nguyen-thesis.pdf) to name a few examples. It will also help to improve understanding of the properties of [Divisor function](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisorFunction.html).

Amicable Numbers is an independent research project that uses internet-connected computers to find new [amicable pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicable_numbers). You can contribute to our research by running a free program on your computer.

The current goal of the project is to find all amicable pairs with smallest member < 10^20.

All new findings are published regularly on the [Amicable pairs list](https://sech.me/ap/) page.
