## NumberFields@Home

View the project [**here**](https://numberfields.asu.edu/NumberFields/).

### Overview

NumberFields@home is a research project that uses Internet-connected computers to do research in number theory. You can participate by downloading and running a free program on your computer.

NumberFields@home searches for fields with special properties. The primary application of this research is in the realm of algebraic number theory. Number theorists can mine the data for interesting patterns to help them formulate conjectures about number fields. Ultimately, this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the properties of numbers, the basic building blocks of all mathematics. Another application of number fields is in cryptography, where they are used in sophisticated factoring algorithms and as the basis for new cryptosystems. There are also distant applications to mathematical physics, including quantum mechanics and string theory. A more detailed description of the project can be found [here](https://numberfields.asu.edu/NumberFields/ProjectDescription.html).
