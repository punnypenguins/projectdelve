### Overview

Install our software to become a citizen scientist and contribute your compute power to help fight global health threats like COVID19, Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, and cancer!

Folding@Home began in October 2000 in the lab of Dr. Vijay Pande at Stanford University. Since 2019, the project has been in the hands of Dr. Gregory Bowman, a former Pande Lab graduate student. In addition to the numerous scientists who have worked on the project over the years, F@h has been supported by thousands of dedicated volunteers who have enabled outstanding scientific research and computational achievements.
