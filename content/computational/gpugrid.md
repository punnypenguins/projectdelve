## GPUGRID.net

View the project [**here**](https://www.gpugrid.net/).

### Overview

GPUGRID.net is a distributed computing infrastructure devoted to biomedical research. Thanks to the contribution of volunteers, GPUGRID scientists can perform molecular simulations to understand the function of proteins in health and disease.

This is a volunteer distributed computing project for biomedical research from the [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) in Barcelona (Spain). GPUGRID is made of many graphics cards (GPUs) joined together to deliver high-performance all-atom biomolecular simulations. The molecular simulations performed by our volunteers are some of the most common types performed by scientists in the field, but they are also some of the most computationally demanding and usually require a supercomputer. Running GPUGRID on GPUs innovates volunteer computing by delivering supercomputing class applications on a cost effective infrastructure which will greatly impact the way biomedical research is performed.

### Runs on:
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
