## MLC@Home

View the project [**here**](TODO).

### Overview

MLC@Home is a distributed computing project dedicated to understanding and interpreting complex machine learning models, with an emphasis on neural networks. It uses the BOINC distributed computing platform. You can find more information on our main website here: https://www.mlcathome.org.

Neural Networks have fuelled a machine learning revolution over the past decade that has led to machines accomplishing amazingly complex tasks. However, these models are largly black boxes: we know they work, but they are so complex (up to [*hundreds of millions*](https://yashuseth.blog/2019/06/12/bert-explained-faqs-understand-bert-working/) of parameters!) that we struggle to understand the limits of such systems. Yet understanding networks becomes extremely important as networks are deployed in safety critical fields, like medicine and autonomous vehicles.

MLC@Home provides an open, collaborative platform for researchers studying machine learning comprehension. It allows us to train thousands of networks in parallel, with tightly controlled inputs, hyperparameters, and network structures. We use this to gain insights into these complex models.

We ask for volunteers to donate some of their background computing time to help us continue our research.

### Runs on:
