## Africa Rainfall Project

View the project [**here**](https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/research/arp1/overview.s).

### Overview

In sub-Saharan Africa, 95 percent of agriculture depends on rainfall, which makes accurate weather forecasts absolutely crucial. However, because rainfall in this area is often localized—sometimes almost at the level of one farm—it's difficult to forecast accurately with satellite data, which show larger weather patterns.

Through the Africa Rainfall Project, researchers at Delft University of Technology will create high-resolution computer simulations of localized rainstorms in sub-Saharan Africa. Because they'll use massive, crowdsourced computing power from World Community Grid, they'll be able run simulations at a much higher resolution—exactly what's needed for localized rainstorms. This has never been done for rainstorms in this region.

As the researchers for the Africa Rainfall Project receive the results of these simulations, they'll be compared with rainfall data from The Weather Company, satellite data, and ground observations. This will help scientists better understand these storms and improve forecasting models. Ultimately, this can lead to more accurate rainfall forecasts for sub-Saharan Africa. In turn, this could give farmers more timely information about when to plant, help them obtain insurance, and become more resilient in the face of climate change.
