## Universe@home

View the project [**here**](https://universeathome.pl/universe/description.php).

### Overview

Universe@home project's two main goals are:

1. to provide scientist with a necessary computational power and
2. to provide the way of involvement for anyone equipped with a computer and willing to take part in the research

We live in times which are marked by the fastest scientific development in the history. Our knowledge grows faster than ever before. We explore the structures of the Universe, nuclei of stars and evolution of galaxies. Using the strength of our minds we crack problems that are not tangible and cannot be examined in laboratory. The technology came as an aid in this struggle. The computers help us to calculate complicated problems and to model extraordinary objects. Therefore the need for computational power is growing exponentially in the scientists' community.

In a different situation are millions of people around the world. The computers industry is evolving extremely quickly and personal computers are available for constantly decreasing prises. Simultaneously, these machines must be strong enough to fulfil the growing needs of users who want to play the newest games and use resources-demanding programs. However, most of the time such computers spend in the idle state when they are used for simple web-browsing or document-writing. The most of computational power stays unused.

As a remedy to both these issues have came the BOINC platform. The innovative infrastructure, which, from one side, serves as the source of huge computational power, and from the other side, gives people the possibility to become involved in huge contemporary science projects utilising their limited resources. BOINC stands for Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing. This system was used for the first time in year 1999 and afterwards dozens of other projects have came into existence. In 2014 the time came for adopting this idea in polish astronomy projects and, at first, the fundamental problems of the stellar evolution will be solved.
