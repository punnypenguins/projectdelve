## BOINC@TACC

View the project [**here**](https://boinc.tacc.utexas.edu/).

### Overview

BOINC@TACC is a project based on the Volunteer Computing (VC) model. It helps TACC/XSEDE researchers in running applications from a wide range of scientific domains (such as, aerospace engineering, computational biology, and earthquake engineering) on the laptops, desktops, tablets, or cloud-based Virtual Machines (VMs) owned by volunteers.

Volunteers can help scientific research by signing up for the BOINC@TACC project and allowing it to run applications on their computers and VMs. They may also need to download the required software from this website. To volunteer, [join BOINC@TACC](https://boinc.tacc.utexas.edu/create_account_form.php) after reading the [project policies](https://boinc.tacc.utexas.edu/info.php).
