## nanoHUB@Home

View the project [**here**](https://boinc.nanohub.org/nanoHUB_at_home/).

### Overview

nanoHUB is a research project, based at nanoHUB.org, that uses Internet-connected computers to do research in nanoscience and nanotechnology. You can contribute to our research by running a free program on your computer.

This project supports over 200 simulation tools deployed at [nanoHUB.org](https://nanohub.org/). These tools are used for both education and research, and they enable simulations that can run in a few minutes or over several hours. The memory requirements can also vary widely, depending on the input parameters to the simulation.  

### Runs on:
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
