## Rosetta@home

View the project [**here**](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/).

### Overview

By running Rosetta@home on your computer when you're not using it you will speed up and extend our efforts to design new proteins and to predict their 3-dimensional shapes. Proteins are the molecular machines and building blocks of life. You can read more about protein folding and design [here](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/rah/rah_about.php).

### Runs on:
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
