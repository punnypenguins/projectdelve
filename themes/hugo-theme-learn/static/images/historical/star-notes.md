## Star Notes

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/projectphaedra/star-notes).

### Overview

Help us transcribe the groundbreaking work of early women astronomers!

We have digitized the notebooks of the Harvard Computers and early Harvard astronomers including Williamina Fleming, Annie Jump Cannon, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, and many others. The goal of Star Notes is to link these notebooks back to their original source material: 500,000 glass plate photographs representing the first ever picture of the visible universe. Each glass plate is identified with a unique plate number. We need you to find and transcribe these handwritten plate numbers in the pages of the notebooks!
