## Measuring the ANZACs

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/measuring-the-anzacs).

### Overview

The Measuring the ANZACs project brings together an international team of researchers, community connections around New Zealand’s military history from the Auckland War Memorial Museum, and the power of the Zooniverse community to explore, analyze, and digitize original World War I personnel files from Archives New Zealand.

Data gathered from Measuring the ANZACs will be used for three main purposes:

- To create a complete and rich index of persons who served in the New Zealand military in World War I and the South African War (also called the Second Boer War).
- To support academic research on the health of New Zealanders led by a team of researchers at the Universities of Minnesota, Guelph and Waikato.
- To provide an ongoing platform for historical and genealogical research on NZ’s World War I soldiers by citizens and scientists around the world.

Measuring the ANZACs builds on work done by Archives New Zealand to complete an organized digital collection of all the pages in the personnel files for people serving in the New Zealand military in South Africa and World War I.
