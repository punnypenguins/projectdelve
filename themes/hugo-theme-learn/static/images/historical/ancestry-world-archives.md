## Ancestry® World Archives

View the project [**here**](https://support.ancestry.com/s/article/Introduction-to-the-World-Archives-Project?language=en_US).

### Overview

The Ancestry® World Archives Project is volunteers from around the world creating searchable record indexes from digitized records. We gather historical records and scan them into our system. You look at the records and type out what you see (so that the facts in the records become searchable). The index you create is added to Ancestry’s free collections and is accessible to anyone who wants to search it.

Active contributors to the World Archives Project receive free access to the original images in the project's databases, and current members to Ancestry are eligible for a discount (10% for U.S. Discovery and 15% for World Explorer) on annual membership renewals. Active contributors are defined as people who have indexed, keyed, and/or reviewed 900+ records in the last 90 days.
