## Old Weather - Naval Rendezvous

View the project [**here**](https://www.oldweather.org/naval_rendezvous.html).

### Overview

This project seeks volunteers to help transcribe sea ice and weather observations from the logbooks of military vessels that sailed Arctic seas in the 19th and 20th century. This information is used to improve climate and sea ice data sets used by scientists every day.

To learn how to participate in this project, visit the Old Weather forum [here](https://www.oldweatherforum.org/viewforum.php?f=41).

In this project we use customized LibreOffice spreadsheets to guide the collection and organization of information extracted from the logbooks posted online, as in the example below. Some logbooks are more challenging than others. Help is available on the forum from our dedicated community of citizen-scientists.
