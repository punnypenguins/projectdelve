## Agents of Enslavement

View the project [**here**](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/gjevon/agents-of-enslavement).

### Overview

Agents of Enslavement? is a research project, which seeks to explore the ways in which colonial newspapers in the Caribbean facilitated and challenged the practice of slavery.

It also seeks to identify the networks and voices of enslaved people hidden within these newspapers.

These crowdsourcing tasks are integral to both these aims as your help will create new datasets for analysis.

One of the goals of this project is to create a database of enslaved people identified within these newspapers. This should be of benefit to people researching their family history as well as to people who simply want to understand more about the lives of enslaved people and their acts of resistance.

This project is run by the Endangered Archives Programme (EAP), which funds the digitisation of endangered archival material around the world. EAP is funded by Arcadia and administered by a small team at the British Library.
