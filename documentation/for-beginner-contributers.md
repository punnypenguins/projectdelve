# What is GitHub?
Put simply, GitHub is a platform where a lot of people host and build code-based projects collaboratively.

Put slightly less simply, GitHub is a website and cloud-based platform that lets developers store, manage, and collaborate on code, and since it's built around Git, it allows users to easily track + manage all changes to that code.
