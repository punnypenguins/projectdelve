# Contributing to Project Delve

Project Delve welcomes file edits, new project additions, and new site features from anyone who wants to contribute.

There are two paths to choose between if you plan to contribute...
* ...and you're **new to GitHub** - Pause here. Go follow the guide I created [**specially for beginners**](https://github.com/punnypenguins/projectdelve/blob/main/documentation/for-beginner-contributers.md) to walk you through everything.
* ...and you **already know GitHub's workflow** - Continue on to the following sections of this doc.

# Style Guidelines

This project is primarily written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), and its front matter formatting follows [Hugo's](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) syntax.

# Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you've met all of the following requirements:

* You have a GitHub [account](https://github.com/join)
* You have [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) set up
* You have forked and cloned the [Project Delve repository](https://github.com/punnypenguins/projectdelve)
* You know how to create a [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)
* You know how to create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

# Adding a new project to the site

### To add a new project: 
1. Make sure you're in your fork of the Project Delve repository.
2. Create a new **branch**. Name it something that is clear and easy for you to understand, such as "adding-new-project-x" or "[issue number]-project-x".
3. Follow the [template instructions]() for the category the new project falls under.
4. Once the file is ready, save your work and push the changes to GitHub.
5. Open a **pull request** for your work:
  - Give it a simple title, preferrably containing the project name, please!
  - You don't have to write a description or summary for the pull request, but please **DO** type inside that box "Issue #[issue-number-here]". This will connect your pull request with the issue you're addressing, and make it easy for me to track changes and close issues instead of leaving one open on accident.
    - If there's not an issue open already for the project you're adding, please take a minute to open a new issue for it and then connect your pull request to that. Thanks!
6. Once your pull request has been submitted, I'll review it as soon as I can. If any changes are needed, I'll let you know so you can make them and then have me check again.
7. If everything is good to go, I'll merge your pull request with the master branch and the new project will be loaded onto the site ASAP!

Thank you so much for helping all of us find more projects to join!
